<h2>Scope and Usage</h2> 
<p>
A concept map defines a mapping from a concept defined in <a href="terminologies.html">one system</a> to one or more concepts defined in other systems. 
Mappings are always framed within the concept of <a href="valueset.html">value sets</a> - they are specific to a context of use.
