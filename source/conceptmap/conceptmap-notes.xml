<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
 <li>The value of the <code>system</code>, <code>version</code> and <code>code</code> elements are the same as used by the <a href="datatypes.html#Coding">Coding</a> data type</li>
 <li>When a mapping relationship is characterized as "source-is-broader-than-target", some explanation of the scope difference SHALL be provided in the comments</li>
 <li>The concept map is a statement of mapping in a single direction. The existence of a matching mapping in the reverse direction cannot be assumed to exist automatically, but only through human review.</li>
 <li>For simplicity, it is better if is only one <code>element</code> for each source concept. if there is more than one, then just as one <code>element</code> can have multiple targets, 
     multiple occurrences of <code>element</code> with the same <code>element.code</code> simply aggregate their <code>target</code> elements as if there was only one <code>element</code></li>
</ul>

<a name="groups"></a>
<h2>Grouping Mappings</h2>
<p>
The concept mappings in <code>element</code> are arranged into groups that share common source/target systems.
These groups have no semantic significance; they exist to make the representation more concise. Concept maps
may contain more than one group with the same source and target - this would be a less concise representation
but may be useful in order to maintain a fixed order for the concepts that are mapped.
</p>
<p>
Concepts that are labeled as 'unmatched' are considered to be unmatched in the target value set,
irrespective of whether they are contained in a group with a stated target system or not. Groups
that contain no target system may only contained 'unmatched' concepts. There is no difference in
the meaning of an <code>unmatched</code> target whether or not there is a stated target system.
</p>

<a name="dependencies"> </a>
<h2>target.dependsOn and target.product</h2>

<p>
In the simple case, a mapping is made from one code to another. E.g. from "home address" in one code system to "address - home" in another. 
But in other cases, the mapping is not a simple one to one mapping. A typical example might be mapping between 
EHR diagnosis codes whose interpretation depends on the field they occur in in the source data: diagnosis, history, or family history.
Furthermore, the target EHR might distinguish diagnosis codes depending on the subject: patient or family.
In this case, it is not possible to map just from one code to another. Instead, the mapping might contain entries like this:
</p>
<table class="grid" style="width:100%">
 <tr><td colspan="3"><b>Source Concept Details</b></td><td><b>Relationship</b></td><td colspan="3"><b>Target Concept Details</b></td></tr>
 <tr><td colspan="2"><b>Code</b> from <tt>http://example.com/ehr/codes</tt></td><td><b>field</b> (dependsOn)</td><td></td><td colspan="2"><b>Code</b> from <tt>http://snomed.info/sct</tt></td><td><b>subject</b> (product)</td></tr>
 <tr><td style="border-right-width: 0px">diab</td><td style="border-left-width: 0px">Diabetes</td><td>diagnosis</td><td><a href="codesystem-concept-map-relationship.html#equivalent" title="equivalent">is equivalent to</a></td><td style="border-right-width: 0px">73211009</td><td style="border-left-width: 0px">Diabetes mellitus</td><td>patient</td></tr>
 <tr><td style="border-right-width: 0px">diab</td><td style="border-left-width: 0px">Diabetes</td><td>history</td><td><a href="codesystem-concept-map-relationship.html#equivalent" title="equivalent">is equivalent to</a></td><td style="border-right-width: 0px">161445009</td><td style="border-left-width: 0px">H/O: diabetes mellitus</td><td>patient</td></tr>
 <tr><td style="border-right-width: 0px">diab</td><td style="border-left-width: 0px">Diabetes</td><td>family</td><td><a href="codesystem-concept-map-relationship.html#equivalent" title="equivalent">is equivalent to</a></td><td style="border-right-width: 0px">161445009</td><td style="border-left-width: 0px">H/O: Diabetes mellitus</td><td>family</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
When attempting to translate the source to the target, an application SHOULD also provide a value for the element(s)
identified in <code>dependsOn.property</code> so that the correct mapping can be performed. 
</p>
<p>
All dependsOn and product values are included in the output of $translate.
</p>
<p>
Interpretation and use of these values is based on the definition of the associated property.
</p>
<p>
The use of valueCode implies the CodeSystem is known from the property definition.  
</p>

<h2>Handling Unmapped Codes</h2>
<p>
If there is no explicit mapping for a code - that is, the engine processing the <code>ConceptMap</code> finds
a group with a matching source system, but not matching element for the code it is translating, processing
proceeds to the <code>unmapped</code> element that specifies what should happen. 
</p>
<p>
The unmapped element can specify one of the following different actions to take if there is no mapping
for a concept:
</p>
<table class="grid">
  <tr><td style="white-space:nowrap">provided</td><td>Use the code source as provided in the <a href="conceptmap-operation-translate.html">$translate</a> request. This is especially useful for translations between versions of the same code system, where only a few codes have changed</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="white-space:nowrap">fixed</td><td>Use the code (and display) explicitly provided in the <code>group.unmapped</code>. This is useful when there's a fall back general code - especially for classifications</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="white-space:nowrap">other-map</td><td>Use the map identified by the canonical URL in <code>otherMap</code>. This is useful when a published concept map needs to be varied for a few specific cases on an institutional basis - the
    institution can create a simple concept that expresses their special cases, and then refer to the general purpose mappings</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that this element is <b>not used</b> when there is an element with a matching code value, and a
relationship value of <a href="codesystem-concept-map-relationship.html#concept-map-relationship-not-related-to">not-related-to</a>.
</p>

<h2>Implicit Code Systems</h2>

<p>
The ConceptMap resource is intended to map between concepts defined in a code system.
It can also be useful to use the ConceptMap resource to define relationships between
concepts defined in other kinds of resources. Here are some common kind of conceptual
maps:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Between two elements in different <a href="structuredefinition.html">structure definitions</a> (e.g. between CDA and FHIR v2)</li>
 <li>Between a code system and a <a href="medication.html">Medication</a> resource</li>
</ul>
<p>
Though these resources are not explicitly defining code systems, they do define 'concept's that
can still usefully be treated as code systems for the sake of subsetting (e.g. <a href="valueset.html">ValueSet</a>)
and defining relationships (e.g. <code>ConceptMap</code>). See <a href="codesystem.html#implicit">Implicit Code Systems</a> for further information.
</p>
<p>
Note that this is different from <a href="structuremap.html">StructureMap</a> because 
that is intended to define an executional transform between structures, not a conceptual 
model.

<h2>Implicit Concept Maps</h2>
<p>
Implicit concept maps are defined in a specification which references the underlying code system structures or 
other release data, and includes a prescribed URI pattern to identify the concept map.  For example, there are 
some implicit concept map URI patterns defined for SNOMED CT. 
</p>
<p>
Implicit concept maps allow the URI to serve as the basis for the ConceptMap $translate operation without 
the need to create a ConceptMap resource instance.
</p>
<p>
Some advantages of using implicit concept maps are that they may be used:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To enable the use of concept maps defined in a code system distribution (e.g., SNOMED CT)</li>
<li>To provide a convenient way, in the definition of a ConceptMap to reference another concept map provided in a code system distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>
If there is an explicit concept map resource with the same URI as a known implicit concept map, 
it SHALL conform the pattern described in the definition of the implicit concept map.
It is up to the discretion of the server how to handle explicit instances when it is 
also able to process requests for the implicit concept map.
</p>
[%impl-note%]
If the relevant server(s) support implicit concept maps, implementers are discouraged from creating their own explicit concept maps with the same URI,
as their existence may create confusion.
[%end-note%]
<p>
Implicit concept map URIs can be used anywhere a concept map URI can be used. Support for implicit concept 
map URI patterns varies across terminology servers. Code system publishers may define implicit concept map 
URI patterns. FHIR terminology servers might or might not support any or all of these URI patterns. Caution 
should be exercised when using concept map URI patterns that have not been defined by HL7 or the code 
system publisher.
