<p>
This page and the RDF forms are particularly prone to change. The page is not 
part of the current ballot, and so at the most it can be a draft page in DSTU 2.
Comments on this and the page content are welcome.

<h3>Why an ontology</h3>
<!-- Use-cases that can be met with OWL that can't be done or are prohibitively difficult by other means -->

<h3>Overview of the ontology</h3>
<!-- data types, base resources, value sets, profiles, concept maps?  code representation -->

<h3>Using the ontology</h3>
<!-- Linking in terminologies -->
