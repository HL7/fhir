<h2>Clinical Module</h2>

<a name="intro"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This Clinical Module focuses on the FHIR resources that represent core clinical
information for a patient. The information contained in these resources are those
frequently documented, created or retrieved by healthcare providers during the course
of clinical care. Resources generated during the course of diagnostic studies can be
found in the <a href="diagnostics-module.html">Diagnostics Module</a>, whereas the
resources related to medication ordering and administration process can be found
in the <a href="medications-module.html">Medications Module</a>.
</p>
<p>
As an introduction to FHIR APIs and resources, please see the
<a href="overview-dev.html">Developer's Introduction</a> or
<a href="overview-clinical.html">Clinical Introduction</a> in the
Overview section of the <a href="foundation-module.html">Foundation Module</a>.

<h3>Index</h3>

The Clinical Module covers the following resources:

<p>
FHIR resources have low, moderate, or high levels of complexity with respect to the number
of primary and child elements as well as the number of referenced resources, found in this
module and others. To better understand the relationships between resources, we recommend
beginning with the lower complexity, core resources such as
<a href="patient.html">Patient</a>,
<a href="condition.html">Condition</a>, and
<a href="familymemberhistory.html">FamilyMemberHistory</a> before addressing a high
complexity resource such as <a href="careplan.html">CarePlan</a>.

<h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
<p>
The clinical resources often represent patient-related data, and as such are
susceptible to data breaching. Necessary privacy and security provision must be
in place for searching and fetching this information. For more general considerations,
see the <a href="secpriv-module.html">Security and Privacy module</a>.
</p>

<a name="uses"></a>
<h3>Common use Cases</h3>
<ul>
 <li>
  <b>Documenting and retrieving the patient's conditions</b> - The <a href="condition.html">Condition</a> resource
  is used extensively throughout FHIR resources to associate information and activities with
  specific conditions. The <a href="condition.html">Condition</a> resource is broadly defined
  to include problems, diagnoses, and health concerns.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>Documenting and retrieving the patient's allergies</b> -  The <a href="allergyintolerance.html">AllergyIntolerance</a> resource
  is used to represent the patient's allergy or intolerance to a substance. There is vibrant debate within the clinical community
  regarding what is appropriate to document as an allergy or intolerance. These terms are used both formally by the Allergy and
  Immunology community as well as informally by patients leading to confusion. Readers are referred to the resource definition
  for the Scope and Usage of this resource. The AllergyIntolerance resource also supports the documenting of the absence of an allergy.
 </li>
  <li>
  <b>Documenting and retrieving the patient's procedures</b> -  The <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a> resource is used to represent 
  physical interventions on a patient like an operation or less invasive interventions like long term services, counseling, or hypnotherapy.
 </li>
 <li>
 <b>Family History</b> - The <a href="familymemberhistory.html">FamilyMemberHistory</a> resource can be used to document known conditions of family members and support
 the creation of pedigrees.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>Care Plans</b> - The <a href="careplan.html">CarePlan</a> resource supports a problem based care plan with references
  to other resources including <a href="careteam.html">CareTeam</a>, <a href="condition.html">Condition</a>, <a href="goal.html">Goal</a>,
  and activities such as <a href="servicerequest.html">ServiceRequest</a>
 </li>
</ul>

<a name="roadmap"></a>
<h3>Developmental Roadmap</h3>
<p>
We will continue to advance the resources through the <a href="versions.html#maturity">Maturity Levels</a>
through the process of development and testing of the resources. We anticipate more widespread implementation of core resources such as Condition, AllergyIntolerance, and Procedure.
Complex resources, such as CarePlan, are dependent on the maturation of its referenced resources and are expected to mature more gradually.
The clinical community will develop use cases to test during
<a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PC/Clinicians+on+FHIR">Clinicians on FHIR sessions</a> at the HL7 Working Group Meetings.
