<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The Alert resource provides a single interface for managing clinical and administrative facts that need to be brought to the attention of
users of clinical systems.  Examples can include many things.  Patient's posing particular risks (falls, physical violence), patient's needing special accomodations (hard of hearing, use easy-open caps), administrative concerns (verify postal address, pre-payment required) or any other situation that
needs to be brought to attention within the context of a particular workflow.  (The workflow relevant to the issue can be identified by the <i>category</i> element.)
</p>
<p>
Usually, resources specific to particular types of issues (health <a href="condition.html">conditions</a>, <a href="allergyintolerance.html">allergies</a>, <a href="medicationstatement.html">active medications</a> will be used to communicate those issues.  However,
in some cases, particularly important information (a latex or severe food allergy) migt be highlighted as an <b>Alert</b> as well as the more typical
resource.
