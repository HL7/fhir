The XML representation for a resource is described using this format: 
</p>
<pre class="spec">
 &lt;<b>name</b> xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir" (attrA="value")&gt;   <span style="float: right"><a title="Documentation for this format" href="xml.html"><img src="help.png" alt="doco"/></a></span>

   &lt;/nameC&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Using this format:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>To build a valid XML instance of a resource, simply replace the contents of the elements and attributes with valid content 
   as described by the cardinality, type rules and content description found in the comment in each element</li>
 <li>Resource and Element names are case-sensitive (though duplicates that differ only in case are never defined)</li>
 <li>Elements must always appear in the order documented</li>
 <li>When an element is allowed to repeat, the elements are ordered, and the technical infrastructure needs to be able to access the items in the right order (see also <a href="conformance-rules.html#cardinality">Cardinality Rules</a> for a further description of elements with cardinality &gt; 1)</li>
 <li>A few properties are represented as attributes: values of primitive types in a <code>value</code> attribute, extension URLs in the <code>url</code> attribute on an extension, and the <code>id</code> property on elements (but not on resources, where the resource id is an element)</li>
 <li>Any of the XML elements may have an id attribute to serve as <a href="narrative.html#internal">the target of an internal reference</a>. The id attribute is not shown in this format</li>
 <li>FHIR elements are always in the namespace <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir">http://hl7.org/fhir</a>.  This is usually specified as the default namespace on the root element. 
   The only other namespace that occurs in FHIR resources is the XHTML namespace - <a href="narrative.html">XHTML is found in most resources</a></li>
 <li>Infrastructural elements must appear prior to any other defined child elements in the following order:
	<ul>
		<li>First, the elements from the <a href="resource.html">base resource</a>, in order</li>
		<li>Second, the elements from the <a href="domainresource.html">domain resource</a>, in order</li>
	</ul>
 </li>
 <li>FHIR elements are never empty. If an element is present in the resource, it SHALL have either a value attribute, child elements as defined for its type, or 1 or more <a href="extensibility.html">extensions</a></li>
 <li>Attributes cannot be empty. Either they are absent, or they are present with at least one character of non-whitespace content</li>
 <li><a name="whitepace"></a>Implementers SHOULD trim leading and trailing whitespace before writing and SHOULD trim leading and trailing whitespace when reading attribute values (for XML schema conformance)</li>
 <li>The lock icon (<img alt="??" src="lock.png"/>) denotes that an element defines or is affected by <a href="conformance-rules.html#constraints">additional rules</a> that control its presence and/or content</li>
 <li>XML comments, processing instructions and formatting are not part of the contents of a resource</li>
 <li>There SHALL be no DTD references in FHIR resources (because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_external_entity_attack">XXE security exploit</a>)</li>
 <li>XML resources SHALL be exchanged using UTF-8 encoding. Specifying the character encoding using an XML declaration (<code>&lt;?xml encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;</code>) is optional but recommended</li>
 <li>Other processing instructions SHOULD not be included and SHALL NOT be required to properly understand and/or present the data or narrative of the resource. 
  Applications MAY preserve processing instructions when handling resources, but are not required to do so</li>
 <li>The MIME-type for this format is <code>application/fhir+xml</code>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="schema"></a>
<h3>XML Schema and Schematron</h3>
<p>
This specification provides schema definitions for all the resource and data type content models it describes. 
</p>
<p>
The base schema is called "<a href="fhir-base.xsd">fhir-base.xsd</a>" and defines all the 
datatypes and base infrastructure types. In addition, there 
is a schema for each resource and a common schema <a href="fhir-all.xsd">fhir-all.xsd</a> 
that includes all the resource schemas. For schema processors that do not like circular
includes, there is <a href="fhir-single.xsd">a single schema</a> that contains everything.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the w3c schema files, this specification also provides Schematron files that
enforce most of the constraints defined for the datatypes and resources, though some are only 
expressible and validatable using <a href="fhirpath.html">FHIRPath</a>. These are packaged
as files for each resource.
</p>
<p>
XML that is exchanged SHALL be valid against the w3c schema and Schematron, though being 
valid against the schema and Schematron is not sufficient to be a conformant instance: 
this specification makes several rules that cannot be checked by either mechanism. 
Operational systems may choose to use schema tools to check validation, but are not 
required to do so. Exchanged content SHALL NOT specify the schema or even contain the schema 
instance namespace in the resource itself. 
</p>
<p>
Given the way <a href="extensibility.html">extensions</a> work, applications reading
XML resources will never encounter unknown elements. However, once an application 
starts trading with other applications that conform to later versions of this specification,
unknown XML elements may be encountered. Applications MAY choose to ignore unknown elements
to foster forwards compatibility in this regard, but may also choose not to - which 
would be the normal behavior for schema generated applications. 
<!-- Applications declare 
their unknown elements behavior using <a href="capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.acceptUnknown">CapabilityStatement.acceptUnknown</a>. -->
</p>

<a name="schema-gen"></a>
<h3>Code Generation Schema</h3>

<p>
In addition to the validation schema, this specification provides a
set of schemas suitable for code generation. These schemas describe
the same XML syntax, but apply less validation to create 
schemas that work better with code generation tooling. 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, these schemas are generated without any <code>xsd:choice</code> elements, 
for code generators that don't deal with choices well. Implementers that 
use these schemas will need to enforce the correct usage of the 
<a href="formats.html#choice">choice elements</a> without schema
support.
</p>
<p>
Implementers making use of schema-driven code generation tooling need
to consider how to handle the <a href="datatypes.html#decimal">decimal</a>
data type. The decimal data type is defined to be precision aware - that 
is, that implementers need to preserve the difference between "2.0" and
"2.00" - this is ubiquitously considered important in handling observed
data in healthcare. Both schemas map this data type to a union of <code>xsd:decimal</code> and <code>xsd:double</code>, but
the base <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#decimal">W3C schema decimal type</a> is specified not to be precision aware. Schema
driven implementations vary as to how precision is handled. Implementers
will need to determine how their generated code handles decimals/doubles and 
consider changing the type for decimal in their schema from <code>xsd:decimal/double</code>
to <code>xsd:string</code>. Specifically, implementers may wish to change:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;xs:simpleType name=&quot;decimal-primitive&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:union memberTypes=&quot;xs:decimal xs:double&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;
</pre>
<p>
to this:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;xs:simpleType name=&quot;decimal-primitive&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:restriction base=&quot;xs:string&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xs:pattern value=&quot;-?(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\.[0-9]+)?([eE][+-]?[0-9]+)?&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
  &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, if supported, implementers may wish to use the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsd-precisionDecimal/">precisionDecimal</a> from the XSD 1.1 framework.
</p>
<p>
Note that most code generation frameworks ignore the pattern restriction.

<h3>Canonical XML</h3>
<p>
Resources and/or Bundles may be digitally signed (see <a href="bundle.html">Bundle</a> and <a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a>). 
</p>
<p>
This specification defines the following method for canonicalizing FHIR resources, when represented as 
XML:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>No whitespace other than single spaces in attribute values and in the XHTML in the <a href="narrative.html">Narrative</a></li>
 <li>Use default namespaces for the FHIR and XHTML namespaces</li>
 <li>Omit all comments</li>
 <li>Always use the Unicode character representation for any XML entities (e.g. <code>&amp;#39;</code> instead of <code>&amp;quot;</code>)</li>
 <li>Include the XML processing instruction <code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;</code></li>
 <li>Using the XML canonical method <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core1/#sec-Canonical">Canonical XML 1.1</a> (<code>http://www.w3.org/2006/12/xml-c14n11</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This canonicalization method is identified by the URI <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/canonicalization/xml</code>. The 
following additional canonicalization URIs are also defined:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr>
  <td>http://hl7.org/fhir/canonicalization/xml#data</td>
  <td>The narrative (<code>Resource.text</code>) is omitted prior to signing (note the deletion is at <code>Resource.text</code>, not <code>Resource.text.div</code>)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>http://hl7.org/fhir/canonicalization/xml#static</td>
  <td>In addition to narrative (Resource.text), the <code>Resource.meta</code> element is removed. This makes the signature robust as the content is moved from server to server, or workflow and access tags are added or removed.  Note that workflow and security tags may contain information important to the handling of the resource, so meta elements should be protected from tampering by other means if unsigned.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>http://hl7.org/fhir/canonicalization/xml#narrative</td>
  <td>The method only retains the <code>Resource.id</code> and Narrative (<code>Resource.text</code></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>http://hl7.org/fhir/canonicalization/xml#document</td>
  <td>The signs everything in a Bundle, except for the Bundle.id and Bundle.metadata on the root Bundle (allows for a document to be copied from server to server)</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>
These canonicalization methods allow systems the flexibility to sign the various portions of 
the resource that matter for the workflow the signature serves. These canonicalization algorithms 
do not work for enveloped signatures. This will be researched and addressed in a future release. 
This specification may define additional canonicalizations in the future, and other specifications might also define 
additional canonicalization methods.
</p>

[%impl-note%]
One consequence of signing the document is that URLs, identifiers and internal references are frozen and 
cannot be changed. This might be a desired feature, but it may also cripple interoperability between closed 
ecosystems where <a href="managing.html">re-identification</a> frequently occurs. For this reason, it is 
recommended that systems consider carefully the impact of any signature processes. The impact of signatures
on <a href="documents.html">Document bundles</a> and their related processes is the most well understood
use of digital signatures.
