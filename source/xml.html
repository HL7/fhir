<h2>XML Representation of Resources</h2>

<p>
The XML representation for a resource is described using this format: 
</p>
<pre class="spec">
 &lt;<b>name</b> xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir" (attrA="value")&gt;   <span style="float: right"><a title="Documentation for this format" href="xml.html"><img src="help.png" alt="doco"/></a></span>
   &lt;<u><b title="Formal Definition (must be supported or understood)">nameA</b></u>&gt;<font color="Gray">&lt;!-- </font><span title="Inv-5: Some rule apples to this element" style="color: brown"><b><img alt="??" src="lock.png"/> 1..1</b></span> <font color="Darkgreen">type</font> <font color="Navy">description of content</font> <font color="Gray"> --&gt;</font>&lt;nameA&gt;
   &lt;<b title="Formal Definition">nameB[x]</b>&gt;<font color="Gray">&lt;!-- </font><font color="brown">0..1</font> <font color="darkgreen">type1</font>|<font color="darkgreen">type1</font> <font color="Navy">description</font> <font color="Gray"> --&gt;</font>&lt;/nameB&gt;
   &lt;<b>nameC</b>&gt; <font color="Brown"><font color="Gray">&lt;!-- </font> <b>1..*</b> --&gt;</font>
     &lt;<b>nameD</b>&gt;<font color="Gray">&lt;!-- </font><font color="brown">1..1</font> <font color="darkgreen">type</font>&gt;<font color="navy">Relevant elements</font> <font color="Gray"> --&gt;</font>&lt;/nameD&gt;
   &lt;/nameC&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Using this format:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>To build a valid XML instance of a resource, simply replace the contents of the elements and attributes with valid content 
   as described by the cardinality, type rules and content description found in the comment in each element</li>
 <li>Resource and Element names are case-sensitive (though duplicates that differ only in case are never defined)</li>
 <li>Elements must always appear in the order documented</li>
 <li>When an element is allowed to repeat, the elements are ordered, and implementations must preserve order (note: the meaning of the order may not be known)</li>
 <li>A few properties are represented as attributes: primitive values in the "value" attribute, extension URLs in the "url" attribute on an extension, and the "id" property</li>
 <li>Any of the XML elements may have an id attribute to serve as <a href="references.html#id">the target of an internal reference</a>. The id attribute is not shown in this format</li>
 <li>FHIR elements are always in the namespace <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir">http://hl7.org/fhir</a>.  This is usually specified as the default namespace on the root element. 
   The only other namespace that occurs in FHIR resources is the XHTML namespace (<a href="narrative.html">XHTML is found in most resources)</a></li>
 <li>Infrastructural elements that are common to all resources are not shown in the xml representation. These must appear prior to any other defined child elements in the following order:
	<ul>
		<li>First, the elements from the <a href="resource.html">base resource</a>, in order</li>
		<li>Second, the elements from the <a href="domainresource.html">domain resource</a>, in order</li>
	</ul>
 </li>
 <li>FHIR elements are never empty. If an element is present in the resource, it SHALL have either a value attribute, child elements as defined for its type, or 1 or more <a href="extensibility.html">extensions</a></li>
 <li>Attributes can never be empty. Either they are absent, or they are present with at least one character of non-whitespace content</li>
 <li>The lock icon (<img alt="??" src="lock.png"/>) denotes that an element defines or is affected by <a href="conformance-rules.html#invariants">additional rules</a> that control its presence and/or content</li>
 <li>XML comments, processing instructions and formatting are not part of the contents of a resource</li>
 <li>XML resources SHALL be exchanged using UTF-8 encoding. Specifying the character encoding using a &lt;?xml encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt; processing instruction is optional but recommended</li>
 <li>Other processing instructions SHOULD not be included, and SHALL NOT be required in order to properly understand and/or present the data or narrative of the resource. 
  Applications MAY preserve processing instructions when handling resources, but are not required to do so</li>
 <li>The MIME-type for this format is application/xml+fhir.</li>
</ul>

<h3>XML Schema and Schematron</h3>
<p>
This specification provides schema definitions for all of the content models it describes. 
</p>
<p>
The base schema is called "<a href="fhir-base.xsd">fhir-base.xsd</a>" and defines all of the 
datatypes and base infrastructure types. In addition, there 
is a schema for each resource and a common schema <a href="fhir-all.xsd">fhir-all.xsd</a> 
that includes all the resource schemas. For schema processors that do not like circular
includes, there is <a href="fhir-single.xsd">a single schema</a> that contains everything.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the w3c schema files, this specification also provides Schematron files that
enforce the various constraints defined for the datatypes and resources.  These are packaged
as files for each resource.
</p>
<p>
XML that is exchanged SHALL be valid against the w3c schema and Schematron, though being 
valid against the schema and Schematron is not sufficient to be a conformant instance: 
this specification makes several rules that cannot be checked by either mechanism. 
Operational systems may choose to use schema tools to check validation, but are not 
required to do so. Exchanged content SHALL NOT specify the schema or even contain the schema 
instance namespace in the resource itself. 
</p>

<h3>Digital Signatures</h3>
<a name="digsig"> </a>
<p>Resources and/or Bundles may be digitally signed (ref to be provided). One consequence of 
signing the document is that URLs, identifiers and internal references are frozen and cannot be changed.
This might be a desired feature, but it may also cripple interoperability between closed ecosystems where
<a href="managing.html">re-identification</a> frequently occurs. For this reason, it is recommended 
that only Document Bundles are signed and then only when all the related resources are found in the bundle.</p>
