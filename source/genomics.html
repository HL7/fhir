    <p>
      The era of precision medicine-- an emerging approach for disease treatment
      and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes,
      environment, and lifestyle for each person-- is upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Precision medicine is fueled by the amazing technological advancements in
      genomics, making it possible (and feasible) to undertake broad genetic
      testing on an individual in a clinically useful timeframe. Whereas not so
      long ago genomics was primarily of concern to bioinformaticists
      interacting with such artifacts as alignment (e.g. BAM, CRAM) and variant
      calling (e.g. VCF) data files, we are now seeing tremendous interest
      across the clinical community for integrating genomics findings and
      recommendations into the EHR and into the care process. To that end, the
      HL7 Clinical Genomics Work Group is developing a set of standards for
      reporting structured genomic data using FHIR.
    </p>
    <p>
      An individual's genetic data set is large and complex, and therefore
      requires systems that can manage the size and make sense of the
      complexity. Unfortunately, due to a lack of widely adopted standards,
      these systems are often incompatible. A standards-based approach to data
      exchange that could be adopted to integrate both genetic data and clinical
      information systems will be crucial to accelerating the integration of
      precision medicine and to make sense of genetic testing results in a
      complete clinical context.

      supports the HL7 mission to create and promote its standards by enabling
      the semantically meaningful exchange of data between parties interested in
      clinical, personal, and population genomic information and family health
      history, which are required to support precision medicine. The committee's

          resource representing a nucleotide or protein polymer. This resource
          was created prior to the development of the Genomics Reporting
          Implementation Guide. Because of this, there are currently
          redundancies between the two which need to be reconciled (e.g.,
          variants), and MolecularSequence will be refactored in the future to
          reduce this redundancy as much as possible. Wherever possible, defer
          to the Genomics Reporting IG to guide your approach reporting genomics
          lab results.
