    <p>
      The era of precision medicine-- an emerging approach for disease treatment
      and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes,
      environment, and lifestyle for each person-- is upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Precision medicine is fueled by the amazing technological advancements in
      genomics, making it possible (and feasible) to undertake broad genetic
      testing on an individual in a clinically useful timeframe. Whereas not so
      long ago genomics was primarily of concern to bioinformaticists
      interacting with such artifacts as alignment (e.g., BAM, CRAM) and variant
      calling (e.g., VCF) data files, we are now seeing tremendous interest
      across the clinical community for integrating genomics findings and
      recommendations into the EHR and into the care process. To that end, the
      HL7 Clinical Genomics Work Group is developing a set of standards for
      reporting structured genomic data using FHIR.
    </p>
    <p>
      An individual's genetic data set is large and complex, and therefore
      requires systems that can manage the size and make sense of the
      complexity. Unfortunately, due to a lack of widely adopted standards,
      these systems are often incompatible. A standards-based approach to data
      exchange that could be adopted to integrate both genetic data and clinical
      information systems will be crucial to accelerating the integration of
      precision medicine and to make sense of genetic testing results in a
      complete clinical context.

      supports the HL7 mission to create and promote its standards by enabling
      the semantically meaningful exchange of data between parties interested in
      clinical, personal, and population genomic information and family health
      history, which are required to support precision medicine. The committee's

          <a href="moleculardefinition.html">MolecularDefinition</a> Resource: The MolecularDefinition
          resource represents molecular entities (e.g., nucleotide or protein sequences) for both
          clinical and non-clinical use cases, including translational research. The resource is
          definitional, in that it focuses on discrete, computable, and semantically expressive data
          structures that reflect the genomic domain. Because the resource focuses on the molecular
          entities rather than specimen source or annotated knowledge, it supports both
          patient/participant-specific use cases and population-based data, and both human and non-human
          data.

          A genomic study might comprise one or more analyses, each serving a specific purpose. 
          These analyses may vary in method (e.g., karyotyping, CNV, or SNV detection), performer, software, devices used, or regions targeted.
