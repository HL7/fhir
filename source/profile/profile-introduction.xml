This specification describes a set of base resources that are used in many different
contexts in healthcare. In order to make this manageable, applications and specifications need to be
able to:
</p>
<ul class="dense">
 <li>Explain how a set of resources is used in a particular context</li>
 <li>Describe restrictions on the use of the elements defined as part of the resource(s)</li> 
 <li>Define the extensions that are used with the resources</li>
 <li>Describe how resources are bound to terminology in a particular context</li>
</ul>
<p>
All these things are done using a Resource Profile, which itself is a resource that 
describes how other resources are used in a particular context. Profiles have a 
metadata section that describes who published the profile, and why, as well as optional
lists of resources constraints, extension definitions, and vocabulary bindings.
