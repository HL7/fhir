<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
This is <b>NOT</b> a resource.  It is not part of the FHIR schema and cannot appear directly in FHIR instances.  It is a logical model that defines a pattern adhered to by
other resources.  This pattern is defined to provide a standard "view" that might be useful for implementers in processing and manipulating all resources that adhere 
to this pattern. Typically, this appears in object frameworks as an interface that the various resources that adhere to the pattern implement.
</p>
<p>
A "document" is a structure with the capability to represent both data content and structure. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
This pattern is intended to apply to all documents.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
Though this pattern may be instantiated by multiple resources (currently Composition and DiagnosticReport), there is some variation in the value 
domains of the underlying resources, and any use of the pattern will need to account for this.
