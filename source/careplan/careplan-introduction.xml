<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p> 
Care Plans are used in many of areas of healthcare with a variety of scopes.
They can be as simple as a general practitioner keeping track of when their 
patient is next due for a tetanus immunization through to a detailed plan for
an oncology patient covering diet, chemotherapy, radiation, lab work and
counseling with detailed timing relationships, pre-conditions and goals.
</p>
<p>
This resource takes an intermediate approach.  It captures basic details about
who is involved and what actions are intended without dealing in discrete data
about dependencies and timing relationships.  These can be supported where
necessary using the extension mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
Comments are welcome about the appropriateness of the proposed level of 
granularity, whether it's too much detail for what most systems need, or not
sufficient for common essential use cases.
