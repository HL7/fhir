Identifier systems are URIs that may be used in the <i>system</i> element of the <a href="datatypes.html#Identifier">Identifier</a> datatype.  In the past,
this page included a list of registered URIs approved for use.  However, this content has been migrated to a location that can be maintained more actively.
</p>
<p>
HL7 Terminology (<a href="http://terminology.hl7.org">http://terminology.hl7.org</a>) provides a registry of Identifier systems which are actively curated by HL7 International. 
If a URI is defined in HL7 Terminology, it <b>SHOULD</b> be used in preference to any other Identifier.system.  If the URI was defined in HL7 Terminology prior to an official release 
of the FHIR core specification, those URIs <b>SHALL</b> be used in preference to any other Identifier.system.  I.e. all system URIs defined on terminology.hl7.org prior to the
release of FHIR R5 <b>SHALL</b> be used in systems claiming conformance to FHIR R5.
</p>
<p>
Many identifier systems are 'local', for example the identifiers used for employee numbers, local medical record numbers, local order and encounter numbers, etc..  The system
URIs for such identifiers are generally determined and managed by the issuing system.  However, 'shared' identifiers that are used across a wide variety of systems, such as
license numbers, government-assigned identifiers, etc.. need to have consistent URIs.  In most cases, the assigners of these identifiers will not have published an official
URI.
</p>
<p>
If an identifier system for a 'shared' identifier is not listed in HL7 Terminology, implementers <b>SHOULD</b> (and HL7 international published specifications <b>SHALL</b>) follow the
process for determining Identifier.system URIs defined by the HL7 Terminology Authority, as documented
<a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TA/Validating+and+Requesting+Identifiers+for+an+External+Code+Systems+and+Identifier+Systems">here</a>.
