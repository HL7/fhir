<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p> 
This resource records significant health events and conditions for people related to the subject. This information can be known to
different levels of accuracy. Sometimes the exact condition ('asthma') is known, and sometimes it is less precise ('some sort of cancer').
Equally, sometimes the person can be identified ('my aunt Agatha') and sometimes all that is known is that the person was an uncle.
</p>
<p>This resource represents a simple structure used to capture an 'elementary' family history.  However, it can also be the basis for
capturing a more rigorous history useful for genetic and other analysis - refer to the <a href="familyhistory-genetics-pedigree.html">Genetic Pedigree</a> profile
for an example.</p>
<p>
The entire family history for an individual is stored in a single resource.
