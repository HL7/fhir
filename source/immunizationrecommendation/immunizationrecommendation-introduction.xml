<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The ImmunizationRecommendation resource is intended to cover communication of a specified patient's immunization recommendation and status across all healthcare disciplines in all care settings and all regions.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the ImmunizationRecommendation resource is expected to cover key concepts related to the querying of a patient's immunization recommendation and status. This resource - through consultation with the PHER work group - is believed to meet key use cases and information requirements as defined in the existing HL7 v3 POIZ domain and Immunization Domain Analysis Model.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
This resource references the following resources:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>AdverseReaction</li>
    <li>Patient</li>
    <li>Organization</li>
    <li>Immunization</li>
    <li>Observation</li>
</ul>
<p>
One of the considerations for this resource is if it is better for this resource to be a profile of the CarePlan resource or if it is more appropriate for this to be a separate resource due to the number of immunization profile-specific data elements.  Please consider this when submitting your ballot comments.
