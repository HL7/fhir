<h2>Defining Extensions</h2>

<p>
All extensions used in resources require a formal published definition which can be used
by application developers, or the applications themselves, to help integrate extensions
into the healthcare process they support.
</p>
<p>
Every extension in a resource refers directly to its definition, which is made available
as a <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a>. A resource can
be <a href="profiling.html">profiled</a> to specify where particular extensions are used.
</p>
<p>
Whenever resources containing extensions are exchanged, the definitions of the extensions
SHALL be available to all the parties that share the resources. Each extension contains a
URI that references the source of the definitions as a <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a>. The source SHOULD
be a literal reference, such as an http: url that refers to an end-point that responds with
the contents of the definitions - preferably a <a href="http.html">FHIR RESTful server</a>
supporting the Resources Profile, or a logical reference (e.g. using a urn:) - for instance,
to a national published standard.
Extensions may be defined by any project or jurisdiction, up to and including international standards organizations such as HL7 itself.
</p>
<p>
Before defining a new extension, attempt to reuse existing extensions defined in one of the <a href="#registration">shared registries described below</a>.  As well, some concepts may be appropriate
to adding as part of the core specification.
</p>

<a name="core"> </a>
<h3>Core Elements</h3>
<p>
Elements are included as part of FHIR resources and data types principally on the basis of
current world-wide usage patterns.  Policy is that if a significant majority of systems 
throughout the world that would use a resource or data type would use an element, then 
that element will be included as part of the resource/data type.  If not, it will be left 
to an extension.  This holds even if the element is very common or even mandatory in one 
or two specific jurisdictions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemBrowse&amp;tracker_id=677">Proposals</a>
suggesting a new core element can be raised by anyone.  (Free registration is required.)  However, given
the <a href="timelines.html">timelines</a> for new FHIR releases as well as the uncertainties associated
with vetting the specification through a ballot process, it may still be necessary to define extensions
even for elements that are likely to be supported as part of the core specification in a future release.
</p>

<a name="context"> </a>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
Extensions are always defined against some particular context - the type of element
that they may be used to extend. The following are possible contexts for an extension:
</p>
<table class="codes">
 <tr><th>Code</th><th>Context type</th><th>Context format</th><th>Examples</th></tr>
 <tr>
   <td>resource</td>
   <td>A particular element (including the root) in a single resource</td>
   <td>The element path for that element, using the standard dotted notation</td>
   <td>Condition<br/>Condition.code</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>datatype</td>
   <td>A particular element (including the root) in a particular data type</td>
   <td>The data type name for primitive types or the element path for complex data types. These extensions can be used anywhere the data type is used</td>
   <td>Address.part.value<br/>string</td></tr>
 <tr>
   <td>mapping</td>
   <td>A particular context in one of the mapped reference models</td>
   <td>The name of the reference model followed by the mapping path. The details of the path depend on the named mapping</td>
   <td>RIM: Act[moodCode="EVN"]</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>extension</td>
   <td>Another extension</td>
   <td>The profile URI of the extension followed by the extension code</td>
   <td>http://myextensions.org/someExtension</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>
Note: For type 'resource' and 'datatype', if the context is an element that can have multiple types, 
then use the [x] qualified name (e.g. Observation.value[x]) if the extension works on all choice types, 
or otherwise an enumeration of explicitly named elements if not (e.g. Observation.valueQuantity)
</p>
<p>
In addition, the extension definition might apply additional constraints with
regards to particular element values of the target that make its use appropriate.
Extensions SHALL only be used on a target for which they are defined.
</p>

<a name="cardinality"> </a>
<h3>Cardinality</h3>
<p>
The cardinality constraints asserted by the extension definition itself 
apply to any contexts where the extension is used.
</p>
<p><b>Minimum Cardinality</b></p>
<p>
If the Extension minimum cardinality is 0, then the extension is 
optional anywhere it appears. A <a href="profiling.html#resource">profile</a> that 
defines the use of an extension may make the minimum cardinality any number up 
to maximum cardinality of the extension itself. Example: Example: 
<a href="extension-birthplace.html">Patient birthplace</a>.
</p>
<p>
If the Extension minimum cardinality is &gt; 1, then the extension must have a 
minimum cardinality of at least the minimum cardinality in any <a href="profiling.html#resource">profile</a> 
that defines the use of an extension. The the minimum cardinality may be any number up 
to maximum cardinality of the extension. Even with a minimum cardinality &gt;0, the 
extension is only required to be present in instances if the inatances explicitly
or implicitly conform to a profile that defines the use of the extension. Example: 
<a href="extension-capabilitystatement-expectation.html">Conformance Expection</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Maximum Cardinality</b></p>
<p>
If the Extension maximum cardinality is 1, then the extension is only allowed once on 
any element on which it appears. A <a href="profiling.html#resource">profile</a> that 
defines the use of an extension can only make the maximum cardinality 1 (or zero if 
the minimum cardinality is 0, and the profile constrains another profile that allows
the extension). Example: <a href="extension-patient-mothersmaidenname.html">Mother's Maiden Name</a>. 
</p>
<p>
If the Extension maximum cardinality is &gt;1, then the extension is allowed up to 
the specified number of times on any element on which it appears. 
A <a href="profiling.html#resource">profile</a> that defines the use of an 
extension may make the maximum cardinality any value up to the specified maximum.
Example: <a href="extension-patient-disability.html">Patient Disability</a>.
</p>

<h3>Use of ElementDefinition in Extension Definitions</h3>
<p>
An extension is a wrapper for url and a value or other extensions. As such,
some of the properties of the extension are defined on the extension
itself, while others are defined on the Extension.value. This 
list provides guidance for the correct usage:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Extension root element:
  <ul>
    <li>Cardinality</li>
    <li>Short, Definition, Comments</li>
    <li>IsModifier</li>
    <li>MustSupport (is used on invocation of the extension)</li>
    <li>Conditions &amp; Constraints. These SHOULD never be on url/value[x]</li>
    <li>Mappings. these SHALL never be on url/value[x]</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Extension.url
  <ul>
    <li>Cardinality = 1...1 (fixed)</li>
    <li>value = canonical url (fixed)</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <ul>Extension.value[x]
    <li>Type</li>
    <li>Cardinality for Simple extensions (not nested): 1...1. Use 0..0 if nested. Note that the actual ED cardinality is defined by the root element</li>
    <li>Binding</li>
    <li>MaxLength, DefaultValue, Pattern, Example, MinValue, MaxValue</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<a name="registration"> </a>
<h3>Publishing Extension Definitions</h3>
<p>
As well as defining the base element structure for resources, HL7 also publishes extensions, including as <a href="extensibility-registry.html">part of this specification</a>.
HL7 publishes such data definitions as extensions rather than as part of the base resource structure
in order to keep the base resource structure simple and concise, and to allow implementers not to
engage with an entire world's worth of functionality up front. Note that HL7 does not generally define
"modifier" extensions - if HL7 publishes an element that modifies the meaning of other elements, it
will mostly be part of the resource content itself, since everyone has to understand the extension anyway.
</p>
<p>
Before extensions can be used in instances, their definition SHALL be published.
HL7 maintains two extension registries:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>HL7 approved extensions, approved by an appropriate part of the HL7 community following a review process, and which have formal standing</li>
 <li>Provided as a service to the community, where anyone can register an extension</li>
</ol>
<p>
Users are encouraged to register their extensions in the second registry, though this is not required.
All that is required is that the extension is published in a context that is available for users
of the extension. So, for example, if a particular
extension is only used within a single institution, the definition of the extension
can be placed on the institution's intranet. However since, by their nature, resources
tend to travel well, it's always better to use the HL7 or other publicly accessible
extension registries.
</p>
<p>
The HL7 FHIR registry can be found at <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/registry">http://hl7.org/fhir/registry</a>.
</p>
<p>
HL7 extension definitions may be balloted alongside resource content as part of the FHIR specification or may
be published as part of separate specifications.
When HL7 publishes extension definitions as part of the FHIR specification, these extensions SHALL
be used for this data whenever the data is represented in instances. Applications SHOULD use other
HL7-defined extensions published to represent equivalent data in the interest of maximum interoperability.
</p>
<p>
To minimize complexity for implementers, HL7 will not elevate widely adopted extensions (defined by HL7 or other organizations) to be content defined
in a core resource in future versions of the resource unless there is widespread endorsement of such a migration from the implementer community.  This
policy ensures that widespread adoption of an extension does not result in a forced migration to a core element. Extensions labeled as draft
may be moved in either direction, but after extensions are finalised as normative they won't be moved.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, an HL7 work group or other body may publish a profile whose sole
purpose is to define extensions expected to be needed by implementers in a particular context; e.g. extensions needed
to map a particular set of <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=185">HL7 v2</a> segments or a <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=186">HL7 v3</a> model.
</p>
<p>
Implementations are encouraged to share their extensions with HL7 and register them with the HL7 extension registry. The domain committees will work
to elevate the extensions into HL7 published extensions or, if adopted by a broad enough portion of the implementer community, into the base resource structure itself.
</p>
<!-- Todo: point to actual registry once it's up and running -->
<p>To avoid interoperability issues, extensions SHALL NOT change their definition once published.  (Small clarifications to descriptions
that do not affect interoperability are permitted.)  Rather than modifying an existing extension, a new extension should be introduced.
Revisions to an extension may extend the set of contexts in which the extension apply but may not remove or constrain any context previously listed</p>
<!-- Todo: Figure out how to manage "deprecating" extensions and pointing at their new versions -->
