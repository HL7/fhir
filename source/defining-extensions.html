<h2>Defining Extensions</h2>

<p>
All extensions used in resources require a formal published definition which can be used
by application developers, or the applications themselves, to help integrate extensions
into the healthcare process they support. 
</p>
<p>
Every extension in a resource refers directly to its definition, which is made available
as a <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a>. A resource can 
be <a href="profiling.html">profiled</a> to specify where particular extensions are used. 
</p>
<p>
Whenever resources containing extensions are exchanged, the definitions of the extensions 
SHALL be available to all the parties that share the resources. Each extension contains a 
URI that references the source of the definitions as a Resource Profile. The source SHOULD 
be a literal reference, such as an http: url that refers to an end-point that responds with 
the contents of the definitions - preferably a <a href="http.html">FHIR RESTful server</a>
supporting the Resources Profile, or a logical reference (e.g. using a urn:) - for instance, 
to a national published standard.
Extensions may be defined by any project or jurisdiction, up to and including international standards organizations such as HL7 itself. 
</p>
<p>
Before defining a new extension, attempt to reuse existing extensions defined in one of the <a href="#registration">shared registries described below</a>.
</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
Extensions are always defined against some particular context - the type of element 
that they may be used to extend. The following are possible contexts for an extension:
</p>
<table class="codes">
 <tr><th>Context type</th><th>Context format</th><th>Examples</th></tr>
 <tr><td>A particular element (including the root) in a single resource</td><td>The element path for that element<br/>Note: If the context is an element that can have multiple types, then use (e.g.) value[x] if the extension works on all choice types, or otherwise an enumeration of explicitly named elements if not</td><td>Profile.resource.element; Person</td></tr>
 <tr><td>A particular element (including the root) in a particular data type</td><td>The data type name for primitive types or the element path for complex data types</td><td>Address.part.value; string</td></tr>
 <tr><td>A particular context in one of the mapped reference models</td><td>The name of the reference model followed by the mapping path</td><td>RIM: Act[moodCode="EVN"]</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Another extension</td><td>The profile URI of the extension followed by the extension code</td><td>http://myextensions.org#someExtension</td></tr>
 <tr><td>A set of some combination of the above</td><td>specify multiple useContext elements - one for each context</td><td>Address; Contact</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In addition, an extension definition might apply additional constraints with
regards to particular element values of the target that make its use appropriate.
Extensions SHALL only be used on a target for which they are defined.
</p>

<a name="registration"> </a>
<h3>Publishing Extension Definitions</h3>
<p>
As well as defining the base element structure for resources, HL7 also publishes extensions, including as <a href="extensibility-registry.html">part of this specification</a>. 
HL7 publishes such data definitions as extensions rather than as part of the base resource structure 
in order to keep the base resource structure simple and concise, and to allow implementers not to 
engage with an entire world's worth of functionality up front. Note that HL7 does not generally define 
"modifier" extensions - if HL7 publishes an element that modifies the meaning of other elements, it 
will mostly be part of the resource content itself, since everyone has to understand the extension anyway.
</p>
<p>
Before extensions can be used in instances, their definition SHALL be published. 
HL7 maintains two extension registries:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>HL7 approved extensions, approved by an appropriate part of the HL7 community following a review process, and which have formal standing</li> 
 <li>Provided as a service to the community, where anyone can register an extension</li>
</ol>
<p>
Users are encouraged to register their extensions in the second registry, though this is not required. 
All that is required is that the extension is published in a context that is available for users 
of the extension. So, for example, if a particular
extension is only used within a single institution, the definition of the extension
can be placed on the institution's intranet. However since, by their nature, resources
tend to travel well, it's always better to use the HL7 or other publicly accessible extension registries.
</p>
<p>
HL7 extension definition registries. 
</p>
<table class="codes">
 <tr><th>Registry</th><th>Search</th><th>Submit</th></tr>
 <tr><td>HL7 Approved</td><td>[TBD]</td><td>[TBD]</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Community</td><td>[TBD]</td><td>[TBD]</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Interim</td><td><a href="http://fhir-dev.healthintersections.com.au/open/StructureDefinition/_search">http://fhir-dev.healthintersections.com.au/open/StructureDefinition/_search</a></td>
 <td><a href="http://fhir-dev.healthintersections.com.au/open/StructureDefinition/upload">http://fhir-dev.healthintersections.com.au/open/StructureDefinition/upload</a></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
HL7 extension definitions may be balloted alongside resource content as part of the FHIR specification or may
be published as part of separate specifications.
When HL7 publishes extension definitions as part of the FHIR specification, these extensions SHALL
be used for this data whenever the data is represented in instances. Applications SHOULD use other
HL7-defined extensions published to represent equivalent data in the interest of maximum interoperability.
</p>
<p>
To minimize complexity for implementers, HL7 will not elevate content defined in an HL7-approved extension to
be content defined in a core resource in future versions of the resource once that resource is normative.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, an HL7 work group or other body may publish a profile whose sole
purpose is to define extensions expected to be needed by implementers in a particular context.  E.g. extensions needed
to map a particular set of v2 segments or a v3 model.
</p>
<p>
Implementations are encouraged to share their extensions with HL7 and register them with the HL7 extension registry. The domain committees will work
to elevate the extensions into HL7 published extensions or, if adopted by a broad enough portion of the implementer community, the into the base resource structure itself.
</p>
<!-- Todo: point to actual registry once it's up and running -->
<p>To avoid interoperability issues, extensions SHALL NOT change their definition once published.  (Small clarifications to descriptions
that do not affect interoperability are permitted.)  Rather than modifying an existing extension, a new extension should be introduced.
Revisions to an extension may extend the set of contexts in which the extension apply but may not remove or constrain any context previously listed</p>
<!-- Todo: Figure out how to manage "deprecating" extensions and pointing at their new versions -->
