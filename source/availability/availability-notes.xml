				<h3>Interaction with other Standards</h3>
				<p>
					The strong desire is that implementers of this resource should consider providing this resource
					in the iCalendar format as an alternative representation. Many 3rd party applications and component providers
					have parsers and user interface controls to display this information.
					This may lower the entry point to integrate outside the health-care specific applications, and into the
					consumer space. This would permit the easier creation of a mobile application that creates appointments
					in the devices native calendar.<br/>
					The iCalendar specification can be found at <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt</a>.

			<li>
				<h3>Slots - not a containted resource</h3>
				<p>
					The slots are not included with this resource due to the volatility of slot resources and the rate at which these
					are updated, and are updated independent of each other, and this availability container.
