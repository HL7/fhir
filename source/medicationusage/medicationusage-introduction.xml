        <h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
        <p> Common usage includes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the recording of non-prescription and/or recreational drugs</li>
            <li>the recording of an intake medication list upon admission to hospital</li>
            <li>the summarization of a patient's "active medications" in a patient profile</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A MedicationUsage may be used to record substance abuse or the use of other agents such as tobacco or alcohol.  This would typically be done if these substances are intended to be included in clinical decision support checking (for example, interaction checking) and as part of an active medication list.  If the intent is to populate social history and/or to include additional information (for example, desire to quit, amount per day, negative health effects), then it is better to record as an Observation that could then be used to populate Social History.</p>
        <p> This resource does not produce a medication list, but it does produce individual
            medication statements that may be used in the List resource to construct various types
            of medication lists. Note that other medication lists can also be constructed from the
            other Pharmacy resources (e.g., MedicationRequest, MedicationAdministration). </p><p> A
            medication statement is not a part of the prescribe -> dispense -> administer sequence,
            but is a report by a patient, significant other or a clinician that one or more of the
            prescribe, dispense or administer actions has occurred, resulting is a belief that the
            patient is, has, or will be using a particular medication. </p>
        <p>MedicationUsage is an event resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a
                href="workflow.html#event">Workflow Event</a></p>

        <h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
        <p>
            <p>The MedicationUsage resource is used to record a medications or substances that the patient reports as being taken, not taking, have taken in the past or may take in the future.  It can also be used to record medication use that is derived from other records such as a MedicationRequest. The statement is not used to request or order a medication, supply or device. When requesting medication, supplies or devices when there is a patient focus or instructions regarding their use, a <a href="medicationrequest.html">MedicationRequest</a>, <a href="supplyrequest.html">SupplyRequest</a> or <a href="devicerequest.html">DeviceRequest</a> should be used instead</p>

                <td>This is a record of a medication being taken by a patient or that a medication

                    patient or another clinician, or derived from supporting information (for
                    example, Claim, Observation or MedicationRequest). A medication statement is
                    not a part of the prescribe->dispense->administer sequence but is a report that
                    such a sequence (or at least a part of it) did take place, resulting in a belief

        <p> This resource is distinct from <a href="medicationrequest.html">MedicationRequest</a>,
                <a href="medicationdispense.html">MedicationDispense</a> and <a
                href="medicationadministration.html">MedicationAdministration</a>. Each of those
            resources refers to specific events - an individual order, an individual provisioning of
            medication or an individual dosing. MedicationUsage is a broader assertion covering
            a wider timespan and is independent of specific events. The existence of resource
            instances of any of the preceding three types may be used to infer a medication
            statement. However, medication statements can also be captured on the basis of other
            information, including an assertion by the patient or a care-giver, the results of a lab
            test, etc. </p>  </div>
