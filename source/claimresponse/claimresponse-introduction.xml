<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The ClaimResponse resource provides application level adjudication results, or an application level error,
 which are the result of processing a submitted Claim resource where that Claim may be the functional corollary of 
 a Claim, Predetermination or a Preauthorization.This resource is the only appropriate response to a Claim which a
 processing system recognizes as a Claim resource.
 </p>
 <p>
 This is the adjudicated response to a Claim, Predetermination or Preauthorization. The strength 
 of the payment aspect of the response is matching to the strength of the original request. For a 
 Claim the adjudication indicates payment which is intended to be made. For Preauthorization no payment will
 actually be made however funds may be reserved to settle a claim submitted later. For 
 Predetermination no payment will  actually be made and no assurance is given that the adjudication of a claim submitted later will
 match the adjudication provided, for example funds may have been exhausted in the interim. 
 Only an actual claim may be expected to result in actual payment.
 </p>
<p>
The ClaimResponse resource may also be returned with the response for the submission of: Re-adjudication and Reversals.
</p>

<p>The ClaimResponse resource is an "event" resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html#event">Workflow Event.</a></p>

		<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>

		<p>The ClaimResponse resource is used to provide the results of the adjudication and/or authorization of a set of healthcare-related
		products and services for a patient against the patient's insurance coverages, or to respond with what the adjudication would be for
		a supplied set of products or services should they be actually supplied to the patient.
		</p>

		<p>The <a href="explanationofbenefit.html">ExplanationOfBenefit</a> resource is for reporting out to patients or transferring data to patient centered applications, such as patient
		health Record (PHR) application, the <a href="explanationofbenefit.html">ExplanationOfBenefit</a> 
		should be used instead of the <a href="claim.html">Claim</a> and <a href="claimresponse.html">ClaimResponse</a> resources as those
		resources may contain provider and payer specific information which is not appropriate for sharing with	the patient.</p>		
		<p>When using the resources for reporting and transferring claims data, which may have originated in some standard other than FHIR, the Claim resource is useful if only the
	request side of the information exchange is of interest. If, however, both the request and the adjudication information is to be reported then the 
			<a href="explanationofbenefit.html">ExplanationOfBenefit</a> should be used instead.
		</p>
	
		<p>When responding whether the patient's coverage is inforce, whether it is valid at this or a specified date, or returning
		the benefit details or preauthorization requirements associated with a coverage 
		<a href="coverageeligibilityresponse.html">CoverageEligibilityResponse</a> should be used instead and be the response to a
		<a href="coverageeligibilityrequest.html">CoverageEligibilityRequest</a>.
