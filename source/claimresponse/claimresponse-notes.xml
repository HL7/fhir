<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<p>
The information presented in different backbone elements, such as <b>.supportingInfo</b> or <b>.adjudication</b>, has a 
different context based on the <b>.category</b> code presented in each, for example, adjudication occurrence may represent an amount 
paid by the patient while another may represent the amount paid to the provider.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, there are several places in the resource which point to other sections of the resource via the use of 
a <b>.sequence</b> number in the referred-to element and an <b>.<i>element</i>Sequence</b> in the referring element.
Sequence numbers appear in such element as <b>.careTeam</b> referred to by <b>.careTeamSequence</b>, 
<b>.diagnosis</b> referred to by <b>.diagnosisSequence</b>, <b>.procedure</b> referred to by <b>.procedureSequence</b>, 
<b>.supportingInfo</b> referred to by <b>.informationSequence</b> and <b>.item</b> referred to by <b>.itemSequence</b>.
</p>
<p>
The <b>.noteNumber</b> element, which appears at the <b>.item</b>, <b>.detail</b> and <b>.subDetail</b> levels in the 
 <b>.item</b> and <b>.addItem</b> structures, contains a list of numbers which match the value of the <b>.number</b> 
 element in the <b>.processNote</b> structure. The process notes are indivdual chunks of text describing a situation 
 associated with insurer explanation of adjudication results. Rather than repeating the same text in the adjudication of
 line item or detail, the insurer can provide the text once in the <b>.processNote</b> structure then include the associated 
 number value in the list of <b>.noteNumber</b>s for each of the appropriate line items or details.
