  The FHIR Asynchronous Interaction Request Pattern API is under active development. Participate in design discussions
  at <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/">chat.fhir.org</a></p>
  [%end-note-np%]

  <h3 id="use-case">Use Case</h3>
  <p>All of the interactions defined in the <a href="http.html">RESTful API</a> are described as synchronous operations
    - that is, the client makes a query and waits for the server to respond with the outcome in the HTTP response. This
    pattern is not always suitable when significant server side processing is necessary.</p>
  <p>The asynchronous request pattern, based on <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7240#section-4.1">rfc 7240</a>,
    caters to this use case and is applicable in <a href="operations.html">Operations</a> and <a
      href="http.html">Defined Interactions</a> that are not processed synchronously or may take a lot of time to
    process. For example, servers that accept a high volume sensor data and queue it for saving, or an operation that
    re-indexes the data in a server to add a new search parameter. Servers may choose which interactions the pattern
    should be supported on (if at all).</p>

  <h4 id="compare-with">Related Pattern: Asynchronous Bulk Data Request</h4>
  <p>For use cases that may return a large amount of data, see <a href="async-bulk.html">Asynchronous Bulk Data
      Request</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="kick-off-request">Kick-off Request</h3>
  <p>The request will support the HTTP methods, URLs, headers and other parameters that normally apply, but servers
    SHALL also support the <code>Prefer</code> header described below. The <code>Accept</code> header in the request
    will dictate the format of the Bundle Resource returned when the request completes successfully or an
    OperationOutcome Resource when it fails, as well any the format for any OperationOutcome Resources returned to
    indicate a transient polling error while the request is being processed.</p>
  <p>For servers that support both the Bulk Data and Asynchronous Interaction patterns, the <code>_outputFormat</code>
     parameter is used to disambiguate the two: when present, the Bulk Data pattern is used. So if an <code>_outputFormat</code> 
     parameter is supplied as part of the request, the server SHALL respond using the
    <a href="async-bulk.html">Asynchronous Bulk Data Request</a> pattern, or if this pattern is not supported by the
    server for the current request type, the server SHALL return an error and <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome
      Resource</a>.
  </p>

  <h5 id="headers">Headers</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><code>Accept</code> (string)</p>
      <p>Specifies the format of the optional <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a> response to
        the kick-off request. A client SHOULD provide this header. A server may support any subset of the <a
          href="resource-formats.html#wire">Serialization Format Representations</a>. If omitted, the server MAY return an error
        or MAY process the request and return a format selected by the server format.</p>    
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><code>Prefer</code> (string, required)</p>
      <p>Specifies whether the response is immediate or asynchronous. Setting this to <code>respond-async</code>
        triggers the async pattern.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 id="kick-off-response---success">Response - Success</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP Status Code of <code>202 Accepted</code> </li>
    <li><code>Content-Location</code> header with the absolute URL of an endpoint for subsequent status requests
      (polling location)</li>
    <li>Optionally, a <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a> in the body</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 id="kick-off-response---error">Response - Error (e.g., unsupported search parameter)</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP Status Code of <code>4XX</code> or <code>5XX</code></li>
    <li>The body SHALL be a <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a></li>
  </ul>
  <hr />

  <h3 id="delete-request">Delete Request</h3>

  <p>After an asynchronous request has been started, a client MAY send a http DELETE request to the URL provided in the
    <code>Content-Location</code> header to cancel the request. Following the delete request,  the server SHOULD delete 
    all data associated with the request and when subsequent requests are made to the polling location, the server SHALL
    return a <code>404 Not Found</code> error and an associated <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Servers MAY delete the data associated with a request after some period of time has passed, either since the data 
    became available or after a status request that returned the data.  (Immediate deletion after returning the data is 
    not recommended as it is possible the client did not receive the response.)  Implementer feedback on recommended time frames 
    for data retention are welcome.  For now, policies will vary by server.  Clients which wish to ensure the data is 
    deleted after retrieval can use the Delete process. <span class="stu">TU</span>
  </p>

  <h5 id="delete-response---success">Response - Success</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP Status Code of <code>202 Accepted</code></li>
    <li>Optionally a FHIR OperationOutcome in the body</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 id="delete-response---error">Response - Error</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP status code of <code>4XX</code> or <code>5XX</code></li>
    <li>Optionally a <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a> in the body</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="status-request">Status Request</h3>

  <p>After an asynchronous request has been started, the client MAY poll the status URL provided in the
    <code>Content-Location</code> header by issuing HTTP GET requests to the location.
  </p>

  <p>A client SHOULD follow an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff">exponential backoff</a>
    approach when polling for status. A server SHOULD supply a <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After"><code>Retry-After</code></a> header
    with a with a delay time in seconds (e.g., <code>120</code> to represent two minutes) or a http-date (e.g.,
    <code>Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT</code>). When provided, a client SHOULD use this information to inform the
    timing of future polling requests. The server SHOULD keep an accounting of status queries received from a given
    client, and if a client is polling too frequently, the server SHOULD respond with a
    <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> status code in addition to a <code>Retry-After</code> header, and optionally a <a
      href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a> with further explanation. If excessively frequent
    status queries persist, the server MAY return a <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> status code and terminate the
    session. Other standard HTTP <code>4XX</code> as well as <code>5XX</code> status codes may be used to identify
    errors as mentioned.
  </p>

  <h5 id="status-response---in-progress">Response - In-Progress</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP Status Code of <code>202 Accepted</code></li>
    <li>Optionally an <code>X-Progress</code> header with a text description of the status of the request that is less
      than 100 characters. The format of this description is at the server's discretion and MAY be a percentage complete
      value, or MAY be a more general status such as "in progress". The client MAY parse the description, display it to
      the user, or log it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 id="status-response---error">Response - Error</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP status code of <code>4XX</code> or <code>5XX</code></li>
    <li>The body of the response SHOULD be a <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a>.
      If this is not possible (for example, the infrastructure layer returning the error is not FHIR
      aware), the server MAY return an error message in another format and include a corresponding value for the
      <code>Content-Type</code> header.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Servers SHOULD NOT use status request failures to indicate a problem processing the original request. Rather,
    status request failures SHOULD use a <a href="codesystem-issue-type.html#issue-type-transient">transient code</a>
    from the <a href="codesystem-issue-type.html">IssueType valueset</a> when populating the <a
      href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a> <code>issue.code</code> element to indicate to the
    client that it should retry the request at a later time.</p>

  <h5 id="status-response---complete">Response - Complete</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP status of <code>200 OK</code></li>
    <li>
      A body containing a <a href="bundle.html">Bundle Resource</a> with a type of <code>batch-response</code>.
      The outcome of the requested FHIR operation SHALL be present as the first entry in the bundle. This entry contains the final result of processing the operation that was initiated by the kick-off request, including:
      <ul>
        <li>The operation's success/failure status in Bundle.entry[0].response.status</li>
        <li>Any error details in Bundle.entry[0].response.outcome (as an OperationOutcome resource)</li>
        <li>The created/modified resource location in Bundle.entry[0].response.location when applicable</li>
        <li>The actual resource in Bundle.entry[0].resource when the server includes a resource body in the response (determined by server policy and/or client-supplied prefer header)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that this is different from the initial kick-off request's response (which only returns 202 Accepted). This entry represents the final outcome of the requested operation after its asynchronous processing has completed.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The outcome of the kick-off request SHALL be present as the first entry in the bundle. A successful completion 
    of the status request SHALL be used whenever processing has completed, regardless of whether the underlying 
    interaction has succeeded or failed. A server SHALL use the status and outcome elements of Bundle.entry[0].response 
    to communicate any processing errors.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the asynchronous operation fails due to an error in the request parameters or processing, the status request returns a <code>200 OK</code> with a <code>Bundle</code> containing the error details. For example, if a client asynchronously invokes a hypothetical $example operation but omits a required parameter:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="json language-json">
    {
      "resourceType": "Bundle",
      "type": "batch-response",
      "entry": [{
        "response": {
          "status": "400 Bad Request",
          "outcome": {
            "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
            "issue": [{
              "severity": "error",
              "code": "required",
              "details":{ "text": "Required parameter 'subject' missing" }
            }]
          }
        }
      }]
    }
  </code></pre>

  <p>When the asynchronous operation succeeds and creates or modifies a single resource, the status request returns a <code>200 OK</code> with a Bundle containing the operation result including the resource location and optionally the resource itself:    
  </p>
  <pre><code class="json language-json">
    {
      "resourceType": "Bundle",
      "type": "batch-response",
      "entry": [{
      "response": { 
        "status": "200 OK", 
        "location": "Observation/123" 
      },
      "resource": { 
        "resourceType": "Observation", 
        "id": "123" 
        // ... additional fields snipped for brevity 
      }
      }]
    }
  </code></pre>

  <p>When the asynchronous operation returns multiple resources (such as a search operation), the status request returns a 200 OK with a Bundle containing the operation result as a nested Bundle:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="json language-json">
    {
      "resourceType": "Bundle",
      "type": "batch-response",
      "entry": [
      {
        "response": { "status": "200 OK" },
        "resource": {
          "resourceType": "Bundle",
          "type": "searchset",
          "entry": [
            {
              "resource": { 
                "resourceType": "Observation", 
                "id": "123" 
                // ... additional fields snipped for brevity 
              }
            },{
              "resource": { 
                "resourceType": "Observation", 
                "id": "124" 
                // ... additional fields snipped for brevity 
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }]
    }
  </code></pre>
