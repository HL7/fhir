<h2>Disclaimer and Warning of Use</h2>
<p>
FHIR Resource definitions developed by HL7 are derived from the considerable collective 
experience of the HL7 membership and wide community feedback from the development and 
application of a spectrum of health care interoperability solutions.  However, Resource 
definitions are generalized to support multiple contexts of use. It is the responsibility 
of the persons or organizations using these Resources to ensure their use is fit for the 
particular purpose in which they are used, including validation for clinical and operational use.

<h2>Notes on Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU) status</h2>
<p>
FHIR is being balloted as a Draft Standard for Trial Use.  A complete description of the rules
for DSTU can be found in HL7's 
<a href="http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/HL7_Governance_and_Operations_Manual.pdf">Governance and Operations Manual</a>. 
However, the essential points for implementers are covered below:
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this phase in the
approval process is to gain real-world implementation experience based on a vetted, approved
version of the specification prior to locking any particular aspect of the specification "in stone".
This specification makes a number of statements about what HL7 will and will not do in future
versions of this specification.  These statements generally concern expectations around forward
and backward compatibility and how the specification will evolve.  However, these statements only 
hold once the specification is approved as a "normative" standard - the approval process that will 
occur subsequent to DSTU.  Between different DSTU versions and between the DSTU and final approved
normative version of the specification and its resources, these rules around compatibility and other
issues will not be enforced.  Elements may be renamed, moved, dropped or otherwise changed.
Extensions may be promoted to core elements and core elements may be demoted to extensions.  Wire
syntax and invocation sequences may be changed.  Other breaking changes may occur.
</p>
<p>
Major changes are not expected, however the risk does exist.  If they occur, such changes will 
not be undertaken without good supporting rationale.  However, long term implementability and 
usefulness of the specification will receive greater weight when evaluating changes that impact on
existing DSTU implementations.  DSTU implementers should therefore provide flexibility in their
architecture that will allow them to more easily accommodate changes to the specification.  They should
also consider how their implementations might peacefully coexist with implementations of future
DSTU and normative versions that may not be fully compatible.

 <li>You can redistribute FHIR</li>

Note: Why not use a standard open source license? We'd like to use <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> or 
<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">a license listed here</a>, but none of them actually deliver on 
the plain English intent above in important ways. We aspire to meet <a href="http://opensource.org/osr-intro">these requirements from the Open

While we resolve the questions around the long term license, the following license,
adapted from the <a href="http://www.omg.org">OMG</a> (thanks for allowing this), applies:
</p>
<blockquote>

 <li>Both the copyright notice identified above and this permission notice appear on any copies of this specification; </li>
 <li>The use of the specifications is for informational purposes and will not be resold or transferred for commercial purposes; </li> 
 <li>No modifications are made to this specification. </li>

This limited permission automatically terminates without notice if you breach any of 
these terms or conditions. Upon termination, you will destroy immediately any copies

<h3>CONFORMANCE</h3>
<p>
HL7 is and shall at all times be the sole entity that may authorize developers, suppliers and 
sellers of computer software or specifications to use certification marks, trademarks or other 
special designations to indicate compliance with FHIR. Software developed under the 
terms of this license may claim compliance or conformance with FHIR if and only 
if the software compliance is of a nature fully matching the applicable conformance points as 
stated in the FHIR specification. Software developed only partially matching the applicable 
compliance points may claim only that the software was based on FHIR, but may 
not claim compliance or conformance with this specification. In the event that testing suites 
or processes are implemented or approved by HL7, Inc., software developed using this 
specification may claim compliance or conformance with the FHIR specification only if the 
software satisfactorily completes the testing suites.
