This specification defines data elements, resources, formats, methods and APIs for
exchanging healthcare data between different participants in the healthcare process.
As such, Clinical Safety is a key concern with regard to the specification and its 
many and various implementations.

<h3>Implementer's Safety Check List</h3>
<p>
FHIR is as simple to implement as we know how to make it. However, due to the nature of
healthcare, and healthcare processes, and cultural concerns, there are a number of features in
FHIR that implementers are obliged to consider in order to implement safe systems.
</p>
<p>
This section is a check list to help implementers be sure that they've considered all the parts
of FHIR that impact on their system design with regard to safety. Note that for this list, 
safety is interpreted loosely, and the list covers security and privacy issues as well. 
</p>

<p>
This safety check list is also available as a <a href="codesystem-safety-entries.html">Code System</a> to facilitate
formal references to these check list items. For instance, application registration processes may wish to 
require applications to assert that they pass some of these checks. As an example, the formal URL for the first check 
item is <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#life-cycle</code>.

<h3>Conformance Related Safety Checks</h3>

<p>
These basic safety checks relate to using the FHIR specification correctly. 
</p>

<ol start="1">
 <li title="life-cycle"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#life-cycle"> </a>For each resource that my system handles, my system handles the full <a href="lifecycle.html">Life cycle</a> (status codes, currency issues, and erroneous entry status)</li>

 <li title="identity"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#identity"> </a>My system has documented how <a href="managing.html#distributed">distributed resource identification</a> works in its relevant contexts of use, and where (and why) <a href="references.html#contained">contained</a> resources are used</li>
 <li title="current"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#current"> </a>My system manages lists of <a href="lifecycle.html#current">current resources</a> correctly</li>
 <li title="error-checks"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#error-checks"> </a>When other systems <a href="http.html#summary">return http errors from the RESTful API</a> and <a href="operations.html">Operations</a> (perhaps using <a href="operationoutcome.html">Operation Outcome</a>), my system checks for them and handles them appropriately </li>
 <li title="link-merge"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#link-merge"> </a>My system ensures checks for patient links (and/or merges) and handles data that is linked to patients accordingly</li>
 <li title="cs-declare"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#cs-declare"> </a>My system publishes a <a href="capabilitystatement.html">Capability Statement</a> with <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinitions</a>, <a href="valueset.html">ValueSets</a>, and <a href="operationdefinition.html">OperationDefinitions</a>, etc., so other implementers know how the system functions</li>

</ol>

<a name="conformance"> </a>
<h3>Date / Timezone Related Safety Checks</h3>

<p>
Dates and timezone issues are well-known sources of confusion and safety issues in clinical applications. 
</p>

<ol start="12">
 <li title="time-zone"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#time-zone"> </a>My system checks for time zones and adjusts times appropriately. (note: time zones are extremely difficult to get correct - see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/timezone/">W3C Timezone Advice</a>, and note that some fields should be timezone corrected, and others should not be)</li>
 <li title="date-rendering"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#date-rendering"> </a>My system renders dates safely for changes in culture and language (the date formats D-M-Y and M-D-Y are not differentiated for many dates, and this is a well-known source of confusion. Systems should use the month name, or otherwise be specific for each date when rendering, unless
   there is solid confidence that such confusion cannot arise, even in the future when information/narrative from resources will be shared much more widely)</li>
</ol>

   
<a name="search"> </a>
<h3>Search Related Safety Checks</h3>
<p>
These basic safety checks relate to managing the search process correctly. Mismatches in expectations between 
client and server (or search requester and search processor) can result in finding more resources than expected or 
appropriate, or much more seriously, missing resources out in search results that were expected to be present. 
</p>

<ol start="14">
 <li title="cross-resource"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#cross-resource"> </a>My system takes care to ensure that clients can (for servers) or will (for clients) find the information they need when content that might reasonably be exposed using more than one FHIR resource. Possible patterns: Support a single search across the applicable resources, or expose data through each applicable resource. See discussion on <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Managing+Overlap+Between+Resources">Wiki Page</a> for further information</li>
</ol>

<p><b>For clients</b></p>

<ol start="15">
 <li title="display-warnings"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#display-warnings"> </a>My system will display warnings returned by the server to the user</li>
 <li title="search-parameters"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#search-parameters"> </a>My system checks whether the server processed all the requested search parameter, and is safe if servers ignore parameters (typically, either filters locally or warns the user)</li>
</ol>
<p><b>For Servers</b></p> 
<ol start="17">
<li title="missing-values"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#missing-values"> </a>My system caters for <a href="search.html#missing">parameters that have missing values</a> when doing search operations, and responds correctly to the client with regard to <a href="search.html#errors">erroneous search parameters</a></li>
<li title="default-filters"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#default-filters"> </a>My system includes appropriate default filters when searching based on patient context - e.g. filtering out entered-in-error records, filtering to only include active, living patients if appropriate, and clearly documents these 
 (preferably including them in the self-link for a search)</li>
 <li title="subsetted"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#obs-focus"> </a>When clients have limited access to data for permission reasons (e.g. the data they receive might be <code>SUBSETTED</code>), my system handles update or create requests tagged in such a way by either rejecting them, or accepting them after carefully considering how to avoid accidental loss of data the updating client did not have access to, and taking into account the possibility that a client update might invalidate data the client was unaware of.</li>
</ol>

<a name="conformance"> </a>
<h3>Deletion Safety Checks</h3>
<p>
Deleting records and/or marking records as no longer valid is a well known
source of safety issues in all applications. This specification allows for 
resources to be deleted, but does not require systems to behave in any 
particular fashion.
</p>
<ol start="20">
  <li title="deletion-check"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#deletion-check"> </a>For each resource, I have checked whether resources can be deleted, and/or how records are marked as incorrect/no longer relevant</li>
  <li title="deletion-replication"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#deletion-replication"> </a>Deletion of records (or equivalent updates in status) flow through the system so any replicated copies are deleted/updated</li>
  <li title="deletion-support"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#deletion-support"> </a>(If a server) my documentation about deleted resources is clear, and my test sandbox (if exists) has deleted/error record cases in the test data</li>   
</ol>

 
<a name="privacy"> </a>
<h3>Privacy Related Safety Checks</h3>
<p>
FHIR defines a set of capabilities to support data exchange. Not all the capabilities that FHIR enables may be appropriate or 
legal for use in some combinations of context and jurisdiction (e.g. HIPAA for exchange between institutions). It is the 
responsibility of implementers to ensure that relevant regulations and other requirements are met.
</p>

<ol start="23">
 <li title="check-consent"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#check-consent"> </a>My system checks that the right <a href="consent.html">Patient consent</a> has been granted (where applicable)</li>
 <li title="distribute-aod"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#distribute-aod"> </a>My system sends an <a href="secpriv-module.html#AoD">Accounting of Disclosure</a> to the consenter as requested when permitted actions on resources are performed using an <a href="auditevent.html">AuditEvent</a> Resource</li>
</ol>

<a name="security-framework"> </a>
<h3>Security Related Safety Checks</h3>

</ol>
<p>Authentication/Authorization:</p>
<p>
Note: Users/Clients may be identified and authenticated in any way desired. For web-centric use, OAuth is recommended.
</p>
<ol start="31">
 <li title="use-ouath"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#use-ouath"> </a>My system utilizes a risk and use case <a href="security.html#oauth">appropriate OAuth profile</a> (preferably <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch">Smart App Launch</a>), with a <a href="security.html#authentication">clear policy on authentication strength</a></li>
 <li title="use-openidconnect"><input type="checkbox"/><a name="http://hl7.org/fhir/safety-entries#use-openidconnect"> </a>My system uses <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (or other suitable authentication protocol) to verify identity of end user, where it is necessary that end-users be identified to the client application, and has a clear policy on <a href="secpriv-module.html#user">identity proofing</a></li>
</ol>

</ol>

 
<a name="other"> </a>
<h3>Other Safety Checks</h3> 
<p>
Obviously, this list is only a small part of the overall safety check list for an application, which will have checks regarding jurisdictionally mandated policies, internal integrity, etc.
</p>
<p>
In addition, server developers should check these specific additional checks for client convenience:
</p>
