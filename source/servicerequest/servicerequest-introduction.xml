		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p>
			ServiceRequest represents an order or proposal or plan to perform a diagnostic or other service on or for a patient (including non-human patients in veterinary settings). Examples of the types of services that may be ordered by a ServiceRequest are:

		<ul>
			<li>diagnostic tests/studies</li>
			<li>endoscopic procedures</li>
			<li>counseling</li>
			<li>biopsies</li>
			<li>therapies (e.g., physio-, social-, psychological-)</li>
			<li>(exploratory) surgeries or procedures</li>
			<li>exercises</li>
			<li>specialist consultation and assessments</li>
			<li>community services</li>
			<li>nursing services</li>
			<li>pharmacist medication review, and</li>
			<li>other clinical interventions.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			A ServiceRequest can represent an order that is entered by a practitioner in a Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) system, or a proposal made by a clinical decision support (CDS) system based on a patient's clinical record and context of care. Planned procedures, perhaps following a defined <a href="careplan.html">CarePlan</a>, may also be represented by this resource.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <code>ServiceRequest.intent</code> element identifies if the resource represents an order, proposal, or plan to perform the indicated service for, or on, a patient. The service to be performed might result in a <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a>; and could be summarized in a <a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReport</a> detailing the performance and outcomes, perhaps through referencing select generated <a href="observation.html">Observations</a>, <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudies</a>, <a href="specimen.html">Specimens</a> or other resources. The various generated resources are typically linked back to this ServiceRequest through their <code>basedOn</code> elements. The ServiceRequest resource may be used to share information to support a referral or transfer-of-care request from one practitioner or organization to another for a consultation, second opinion, or short- or longer-term management of health issues or problems.
		</p>
		<p>
			The general work flow that this resource facilitates is that a clinical system creates a service request. The service request is then accessed by or exchanged, perhaps via intermediaries, with a system that represents an organization (e.g., diagnostic or imaging service, surgical team, physical therapy department) that can perform the procedure. The organization receiving the service request will, after it accepts the request, update the request as the work is performed, and then finally issue a report that references the requests that it fulfilled.
		</p>
		<p>
			Only a single procedure is requested by each ServiceRequest; if a workflow requires requesting multiple procedures simultaneously, this is done using multiple ServiceRequests. These instances can be linked in different ways, depending on the needs of the workflow. For guidance, refer to the <a href="request.html">Request pattern</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Multiple ServiceRequests may exist that are associated in some way. When the association is a simple grouping, say for billing, that grouping can be indicated with the <code>ServiceRequest.requisition</code> element. When the ServiceRequest execution needs to be coordinated in some fashion, another resource such as <a href="requestorchestration.html">RequestOrchestration</a> may be needed.

		<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
	    <p>
	     ServiceRequest is a record of a proposal/plan or order for a service to be performed that would result in a <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a>,
		 <a href="observation.html">Observation</a>, 
		 <a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReport</a>, 
		 <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a>, or similar resource. In contrast to ServiceRequest, <a href="task.html">Task</a> spans both intent and event, tracks the execution through to completion, and is intended for "administrative" actions like requesting and tracking things to be done to a record, or keeping track of a checklist of steps such to be performed as part of a fulfilment process. A ServiceRequest can be higher-level authorization that triggered the creation of Task, or it can be the "request" resource Task is seeking to fulfill. For further information about this separation of responsibilities between ServiceRequest and Task, 
		 refer to the <a href="request.html#fulfillment">Fulfillment/Execution</a> section of the Request pattern.
	    </p>
	    <p>
        ServiceRequest and <a href="communicationrequest.html">CommunicationRequest</a> are related. A CommunicationRequest is a request to merely disclose information. Whereas a ServiceRequest would be used to request information as part of training or counseling - i.e., when the process will involve verification of the patient's comprehension or an attempt to change the patient's mental state. In some workflows both may exist. For example, upon receiving a CommunicationRequest a practitioner might initiate a ServiceRequest.

		The ServiceRequest.orderDetail structure is subject to further feedback based on use as the modeling creates a challenge when there is no focus, while an alternate structure would yield a requirement to repeat the focus attribute on each code/value pair.
