	<h2>Notes:</h2>

	<h3>Interaction with other Standards</h3>
	<p>
		The strong desire is that implementers of this resource should consider providing this resource
		in the iCalendar format as an alternative representation. Many 3rd party applications and component providers
		have parsers and user interface controls to display this information.
		This may lower the entry point to integrate outside the health-care specific applications, and into the
		consumer space. This would permit the easier creation of a mobile application that creates appointments
		in the devices native calendar.<br/>
		The iCalendar specification can be found at <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Slots - not a contained resource</h3>
	<p>
		Due to the dynamic nature of slots they are not included as a part of this resource.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is anticipated that this resource is likely to be updated intermittently when the scope
		of slots is changed, i.e. to change the period of slots in the planning horizon.
		This could be performed each night to move the start and end date forward to
		keep the planning horizon as exactly 4 weeks.
	</p>
	<p>
		The slot resource however is anticipated to be updated very regularly as the appointments
		that reference them are created/updated/cancelled.
