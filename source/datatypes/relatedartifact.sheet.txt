
=== Sheet Bindings =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = RelatedArtifactType
  Binding = code list
  Reference = #related-artifact-type
  Definition = The type of relationship to the related artifact
  Conformance = required

=== Sheet related-artifact-type =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Code = documentation
  Display = Documentation
  Definition = Additional documentation for the knowledge resource. This would include additional instructions on usage as well as additional information on clinical context or appropriateness

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Id = 2
  Code = justification
  Display = Justification
  Definition = A summary of the justification for the knowledge resource including supporting evidence, relevant guidelines, or other clinically important information. This information is intended to provide a way to make the justification for the knowledge resource available to the consumer of interventions or results produced by the knowledge resource

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Id = 3
  Code = citation
  Display = Citation
  Definition = Bibliographic citation for papers, references, or other relevant material for the knowledge resource. This is intended to allow for citation of related material, but that was not necessarily specifically prepared in connection with this knowledge resource

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Id = 4
  Code = predecessor
  Display = Predecessor
  Definition = The previous version of the knowledge resource

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Id = 5
  Code = successor
  Display = Successor
  Definition = The next version of the knowledge resource

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Id = 6
  Code = derived-from
  Display = Derived From
  Definition = The knowledge resource is derived from the related artifact. This is intended to capture the relationship in which a particular knowledge resource is based on the content of another artifact, but is modified to capture either a different set of overall requirements, or a more specific set of requirements such as those involved in a particular institution or clinical setting

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Id = 7
  Code = depends-on
  Display = Depends On
  Definition = The knowledge resource depends on the given related artifact

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Id = 8
  Code = composed-of
  Display = Composed Of
  Definition = The knowledge resource is composed of the given related artifact

=== Sheet Invariants =====================================

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = RelatedArtifact
  Type = Structure
  Short Name = Related artifacts for a knowledge resource
  Definition = Related artifacts such as additional documentation, justification, or bibliographic references
  Requirements = Knowledge resources must be able to provide enough information for consumers of the content (and/or interventions or results produced by the content) to be able to determine and understand the justification for and evidence in support of the content
  Comments = Each related artifact is either an attachment, or a reference to another knowledge resource, but not both
  Committee Notes = This data type was defined to support reuse of the pattern of contributor elements across multiple conformance and knowledge asset resources

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = RelatedArtifact.type
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = code
  Binding = RelatedArtifactType
  Short Name = documentation | justification | citation | predecessor | successor | derived-from | depends-on | composed-of
  Definition = The type of relationship to the related artifact

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = RelatedArtifact.display
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string
  Short Name = Brief description of the related artifact
  Definition = A brief description of the document or knowledge resource being referenced, suitable for display to a consumer

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = RelatedArtifact.citation
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string
  Short Name = Bibliographic citation for the artifact
  Definition = A bibliographic citation for the related artifact. This text SHOULD be formatted according to an accepted citation format
  Comments = Additional structured information about citations should be captured as extensions

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = RelatedArtifact.url
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = uri
  Short Name = Url for the related artifact
  Definition = A url for the artifact that can be followed to access the actual content
  Comments = If a document or resource element is present, this element SHALL NOT be provided (use the url or reference in the Attachment or resource reference)

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = RelatedArtifact.document
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Attachment
  Short Name = The related document
  Definition = The document being referenced, represented as an attachment. This is exclusive with the resource element

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Element = RelatedArtifact.resource
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Any)
  Short Name = The related resource
  Definition = The related resource, such as a library, value set, profile, or other knowledge resource
  Comments = If the type is predecessor, this is a reference to the succeeding knowledge resource. If the type is successor, this is a reference to the prior knowledge resource
