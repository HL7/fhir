      <p>The value set to instantiate this attribute should be drawn from a terminologically robust code system that consists of or contains route of administration concepts.</p>
      
      <p>Possible sources include:</p>
      
      <ul>
        
        <li>SNOMED CT - Children of SCTID: 284009009 &quot;route of administration value&quot;</li>
        
        <li>ISO 11239 - Routes of administration</li>
        
        <li>NCIt - Children of NCIt concept C66729 &quot;route of administration&quot; (note: this covers SDTM and FDA route of administration concepts)</li>
        
        <li>EDQM - Route of administration</li>
      
      </ul>
      
      <p>SNOMED CT is being used here as the example terminology.</p>
      
      <p>Note: to avoid confusion with other attributes in this resource concepts that are pre-coordinated with method and/or site of administration 
      (e.g. &quot;intravenous infusion&quot; where &quot;infusion&quot; is the method or &quot;IV into left subclavian vein&quot; where &quot;left subclavian vein&quot; is the site) 
      should not be used in this value set.
