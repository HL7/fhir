 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement
  Type = Type
  Short Label = Describes a required data item
  Definition = Describes a required data item for evaluation in terms of the type of data, and optional code- or date-based filters of the data

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.type
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = code
  Binding = FHIRAllTypes
  Short Label = The type of the required data
  Definition = The type of the required data, specified as the type name of a resource. For profiles, this value is set to the type of the base resource of the profile

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.profile
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = Reference(StructureDefinition)
  Short Label = The profile of the required data
  Definition = The profile of the required data, specified as the uri of the profile definition

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.mustSupport
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = string
  Short Label = Indicates that specific structure elements are referenced by the knowledge module
  Definition = Indicates that specific elements of the type are referenced by the knowledge module and must be supported by the consumer in order to obtain an effective evaluation. This does not mean that a value is required for this element, only that the consuming system must understand the element and be able to provide values for it if they are available

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.codeFilter
  Card. = 0..*
  Short Label = Code filters for the data
  Definition = Code filters specify additional constraints on the data, specifying the value set of interest for a particular element of the data

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.codeFilter.path
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = string
  Short Label = The code-valued attribute of the filter
  Definition = The code-valued attribute of the filter. The specified path must be resolvable from the type of the required data. The path is allowed to contain qualifiers (.) to traverse sub-elements, as well as indexers ([x]) to traverse multiple-cardinality sub-elements. Note that the index must be an integer constant. The path must resolve to an element of type code, Coding, or CodeableConcept

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.codeFilter.valueSet[x]
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string|Reference(ValueSet)
  Short Label = Valueset for the filter
  Definition = The valueset for the code filter. The valueSet and value elements are exclusive. If valueSet is specified, the filter will return only those data items for which the value of the code-valued element specified in the path is a member of the specified valueset

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.codeFilter.valueCode
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = code
  Short Label = Code value of the filter
  Definition = The codes for the code filter. Only one of valueSet, valueCode, valueConding, or valueCodeableConcept may be specified. If values are given, the filter will return only those data items for which the code-valued attribute specified by the path has a value that is one of the specified codes

 -- Row 9 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.codeFilter.valueCoding
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = Coding
  Short Label = Coding value of the filter
  Definition = The Codings for the code filter. Only one of valueSet, valueCode, valueConding, or valueCodeableConcept may be specified. If values are given, the filter will return only those data items for which the code-valued attribute specified by the path has a value that is one of the specified Codings

 -- Row 10 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.codeFilter.valueCodeableConcept
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Short Label = CodeableConcept value of the filter
  Definition = The CodeableConcepts for the code filter. Only one of valueSet, valueCode, valueConding, or valueCodeableConcept may be specified. If values are given, the filter will return only those data items for which the code-valued attribute specified by the path has a value that is one of the specified CodeableConcepts

 -- Row 11 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.dateFilter
  Card. = 0..*
  Short Label = Date filters for the data
  Definition = Date filters specify additional constraints on the data in terms of the applicable date range for specific elements

 -- Row 12 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.dateFilter.path
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = string
  Short Label = The date-valued attribute of the filter
  Definition = The date-valued attribute of the filter. The specified path must be resolvable from the type of the required data. The path is allowed to contain qualifiers (.) to traverse sub-elements, as well as indexers ([x]) to traverse multiple-cardinality sub-elements. Note that the index must be an integer constant. The path must resolve to an element of type dateTime, Period, Schedule, or Timing

 -- Row 13 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.dateFilter.value[x]
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = dateTime|Period|Duration
  Short Label = The value of the filter, as a Period, DateTime, or Duration value
  Definition = The value of the filter. If period is specified, the filter will return only those data items that fall within the bounds determined by the Period, inclusive of the period boundaries. If dateTime is specified, the filter will return only those data items that are equal to the specified dateTime. If a Duration is specified, the filter will return only those data items that fall within Duration from now
