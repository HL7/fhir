  <description value="Codes that describe application obligations for handling FHIR content. There are three kinds of codes in this code system:&#10;
* SHALL/SHOULD&#10;
* Functional codes - these describe a functional behavior applications may implement, and have the concept property should-shall = true, and have SHALL: or SHOULD: prepended to them when used e.g. SHALL:will-send&#10;
* Composite codes - these specialise AggregateConcepts, and have an concept property 'expression' that defines them in terms of a set of functional codes&#10;
&#10;
The functional codes are grouped into three different high level categories:&#10;
* ResourceProducerObligations - functions that pertain to applications that produce resources (typically from databases or forms)&#10;
* ExchangerObligations - functions that pertain to applications that transfer resources between other applications (including FHIR repositories)&#10;
* ResourceConsumerObligations - functions that pertain to applications that consume the content of resources and do something with them&#10;
&#10;
Note that applications typically produce and consume resources, whether client, server or something else again, and &#10;
many applications transfer resources as well&#10;

      <definition value="Notes: this rule is vague in that doesn't specify any particular handling of the element. But it's important because an application that ignores this element is non-conformant. A good example would be a status code of 'entered-in-error' - how exactly a Resource Consumer handles this depends on the use case etc, but the application can never simply ignore such a status code. Note that whether the resource or information from it is stored for later use is irrelevant - when the resource or information in it is processed, the consequences of the element are considered. That may mean not retaining the information for later use, or informing the user, etc. Typically, this obligation marks that there are known patient safety issues that can arise if the element is ignored. Implementers should pay particular attention to the possible range of values for the element from a safety perspective."/>
