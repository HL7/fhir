
=== Sheet Bindings =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = UsageContextType
  Binding = code list
  Reference = #usage-context-type
  Definition = A code that specifies a type of context being specified by a usage context
  Conformance = extensible

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = UsageContextValue
  Binding = value set
  Reference = http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/use-context
  Definition = A code that defines the specific value for the context being specified
  Conformance = example

=== Sheet usage-context-type =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Code = gender
  Display = Gender
  Definition = The gender of the patient. For this context type, the value should be a code taken from the http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/administrative-gender value set

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Id = 2
  Code = age
  Display = Age Range
  Definition = The age of the patient. For this context type, the value should be a range the specifies the applicable ages or a code from the MeSH value set http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v3-AgeGroupObservationValue

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Id = 3
  Code = focus
  Display = Clinical Focus
  Definition = The clinical concept(s) addressed by the artifact. For example, disease, diagnostic test interpretation, medication ordering as in http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/condition-code.

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Id = 4
  Code = user
  Display = User Type
  Definition = The clinical specialty of the context in which the patient is being treated - For example, PCP, Patient, Cardiologist, Behavioral Professional, Oral Health Professional, Prescriber, etc... taken from the NUCC Health Care provider taxonomy value set http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/provider-taxonomy.

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Id = 5
  Code = workflow
  Display = Workflow Setting
  Definition = The settings in which the artifact is intended for use. For example, admission, pre-op, etc. For example, the ActEncounterCode value set http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v3-ActEncounterCode

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Id = 6
  Code = task
  Display = Workflow Task
  Definition = The context for the clinical task(s) represented by this artifact. Can be any task context represented by the HL7 ActTaskCode value set http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v3-ActTaskCode. General categories include: order entry, patient documentation and patient information review.

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Id = 7
  Code = venue
  Display = Clinical Venue
  Definition = The venue in which an artifact could be used. For example, Outpatient, Inpatient, Home, Nursing home. The code value may originate from either the HL7 ActEncounterCode http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v3-ActEncounterCode or NUCC non-individual provider codes http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/provider-taxonomy

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Id = 8
  Code = species
  Display = Species
  Definition = The species to which an artifact applies. For example, SNOMED - 387961004 | Kingdom Animalia (organism).

=== Sheet Invariants =====================================

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = UsageContext
  Type = Structure
  Short Name = Describes the context of use for a conformance or knowledge resource
  Definition = Specifies clinical/business/etc metadata that can be used to retrieve, index and/or categorize an artifact. This metadata can either be specific to the applicable population (e.g., age category, DRG) or the specific context of care (e.g., venue, care setting, provider of care)
  Requirements = Consumers of the resource must be able to determine the intended applicability for the resource. Ideally, this information would be used programmatically to determine when and how it should be incorporated or exposed

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = UsageContext.code
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = Coding
  Binding = UsageContextType
  Short Name = Type of context being specified
  Definition = A code that identifies the type of context being specified by this usage context

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = UsageContext.value[x]
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = CodeableConcept | Quantity | Range
  Binding = UsageContextValue
  Short Name = Value that defines the context
  Definition = A value that defines the context specified in this context of use. The interpretation of the value is defined by the code
