 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Context = Reference
  English = SHALL have a local reference if the resource is provided inline
  XPath = not(starts-with(f:reference/@value, \'#\')) or exists(ancestor::*[self::f:entry or self::f:parameter]/f:resource/f:*/f:contained/f:*[f:id/@value=substring-after(current()/f:reference/@value, \'#\')]|/*/f:contained/f:*[f:id/@value=substring-after(current()/f:reference/@value, \'#\')])

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Reference
  Type = Type
  Short Label = A reference from one resource to another
  Definition = A reference from one resource to another
  RIM Mapping = The target of a resource reference is a RIM entry point (Act, Role, or Entity)

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = !Reference.type
  Card. = 0..1
  Inv. = 1
  Type = code
  Binding = ResourceType
  Short Label = Resource Type
  Definition = The name of one of the resource types defined in this specification to identify the type of the resource being referenced
  Comments = Whether or not the type of the resource reference is fixed for a particular element, the reference includes the resource type
  RIM Mapping = N/A

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = Reference.reference
  Card. = 0..1
  Inv. = 1
  Type = string
  Short Label = Relative, internal or absolute URL reference
  Definition = A reference to a location at which the other resource is found. The reference may be a relative reference, in which case it is relative to the service base URL, or an absolute URL that resolves to the location where the resource is found. The reference may be version specific or not. If the reference is not to a FHIR RESTful server, then it should be assumed to be version specific. Internal fragment references (start with \'#\') refer to contained resources
  Comments = Using absolute URLs provides a stable scalable approach suitable for a cloud/web context, while using relative/logical references provides a flexible approach suitable for use when trading across closed eco-system boundaries.   Absolute URLs do not need to point to a FHIR RESTful server, though this is the preferred approach. If the url conforms to the structure \"/[type]/[id]\" then it should be assumed that the reference is to a FHIR RESTful server
  RIM Mapping = N/A

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = Reference.display
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string
  Short Label = Text alternative for the resource
  Definition = Plain text narrative that identifies the resource in addition to the resource reference
  Comments = This is generally not the same as the Resource.text of the referenced resource.  The purpose is to identify what\'s being referenced, not to fully describe it.
  RIM Mapping = N/A
