 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Context = Reference
  English = SHALL have a contained resource if a local reference is provided
  XPath = not(starts-with(f:reference/@value, \'#\')) or exists(ancestor::*[self::f:entry or self::f:parameter]/f:resource/f:*/f:contained/f:*[f:id/@value=substring-after(current()/f:reference/@value, \'#\')]|/*/f:contained/f:*[f:id/@value=substring-after(current()/f:reference/@value, \'#\')])
  Expression = reference.startsWith(\'#\').not() or (reference.substring(1).trace(\'url\') in %resource.contained.id.trace(\'ids\'))

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Reference
  Type = Type
  Short Name = A reference from one resource to another
  Definition = A reference from one resource to another
  Comments = References SHALL be a reference to an actual FHIR resource, and SHALL be resolveable (allowing for access control, temporary unavailability, etc). Resolution can be either by retrieval from the URL, or, where applicable by resource type, by treating an absolute reference as a canonical URL and looking it up in a local registry/repository
  RIM Mapping = The target of a resource reference is a RIM entry point (Act, Role, or Entity)

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = Reference.reference
  Card. = 0..1
  Inv. = 1
  Type = string
  Short Name = Literal reference, Relative, internal or absolute URL
  Definition = A reference to a location at which the other resource is found. The reference may be a relative reference, in which case it is relative to the service base URL, or an absolute URL that resolves to the location where the resource is found. The reference may be version specific or not. If the reference is not to a FHIR RESTful server, then it should be assumed to be version specific. Internal fragment references (start with \'#\') refer to contained resources
  Comments = Using absolute URLs provides a stable scalable approach suitable for a cloud/web context, while using relative/logical references provides a flexible approach suitable for use when trading across closed eco-system boundaries.   Absolute URLs do not need to point to a FHIR RESTful server, though this is the preferred approach. If the URL conforms to the structure \"/[type]/[id]\" then it should be assumed that the reference is to a FHIR RESTful server
  RIM Mapping = N/A

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = Reference.identifier
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Identifier
  Short Name = Logical reference, when literal reference is not known
  Definition = An identifier for the other resource. This is used when there is no way to reference the other resource directly, either because the entity is not available through a FHIR server, or because there is no way for the author of the resource to convert a known identifier to an actual location. There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference
  Comments = When an identifier is provided in place of a reference, any system processing the reference will only be able to resolve the identifier to a reference if it understands the business context in which the identifier is used. Sometimes this is global (e.g. a national identifier) but often it is not. For this reason, none of the useful mechanisms described for working with references (e.g. chaining, includes) are possible, nor should servers be expected to be able resolve the reference. Servers may accept an identifier based reference untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy. \n\nWhen both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is preferred. Applications processing the resource are allowed - but not required - to check that the identifier matches the literal reference\n\nApplications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the logical reference present, or remove it

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = Reference.display
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string
  Short Name = Text alternative for the resource
  Definition = Plain text narrative that identifies the resource in addition to the resource reference
  Comments = This is generally not the same as the Resource.text of the referenced resource.  The purpose is to identify what\'s being referenced, not to fully describe it.
  RIM Mapping = N/A
  Translatable = y
