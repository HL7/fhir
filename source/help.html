            controlling whether or not a particular section of an order set appears
            based on the conditions that a patient has, or it may be as complex as

            instance.
        </dd>
        <dt>Coding</dt>
        <dd>is a type of FHIR datatypes where a resource
            instance element has a code and a system element that identifies where

        <dt>Conditional Reference</dt>
        <dd>is a search URI that describes
            how to find the correct reference when the logical id of a resource is

        <dt>Conformance Verb</dt>
        <dd>is a set verb form for indicating a
            requirement. HL7 FHIR specification uses the conformance verbs SHALL,
            SHOULD, and MAY as defined in RFC 2119. The correct verb for indicating
            an absolute requirement is “SHALL”. Universally accepted standardization
            terminology does not recognize "MUST". Use "SHALL" to indicate a
            mandatory aspect or an aspect on which there is no option. The correct
            verb form for indicating a recommendation is "SHOULD." The correct verb
            form for an option is "MAY." The negatives are SHALL NOT, SHOULD
            NOT.
