		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
	    <p>
				<strong>This resource is a <em>request</em> resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a>.</strong>
	    </p>
	    <p>
        This resource describes the request for the use of a device by a patient. The device may be any
        pertinent device specified in the Device resource. Examples of devices that may be requested
        include wheelchair, hearing aids, or an insulin pump. The request may lead to the dispensing
        of the device to the patient or for use by the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
        The device use request may represent an order or a prescription entered by a practitioner in a CPOE
        system or a proposal made by a clinical decision support (CDS) system based
        on a patient's clinical record and context of care.

		<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
		<p>
This resource deals with the allocation of a device to a patient and while it may contain instructions on how to use the device, the data about getting the device to the patient is addressed in other resources.  For example, Certain devices must be implanted via a surgical or other procedure and the implantation or explantation is represented in the [Procedure](procedure.html) or [ProcedureRequest](procedurerequest.html) resource.
