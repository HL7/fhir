<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p> 
A Composition is the basic structure from which <a href="documents.html">FHIR Documents</a> - 
immutable bundles with attested narrative - are built. A single logical composition may be 
associated with a series of derived documents, each of which is a frozen copy of the 
composition.
</p>

<p>
Note: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EN_13606">EN 13606</a> uses the term "Composition" 
to refer to a single commit to an EHR system, and offers some common examples: a composition 
containing a consultation note, a progress note, a report or a letter, an investigation report, 
a prescription form or a set of bedside nursing observations. Using Composition for an attested
EHR commit is a valid use of the Composition resource, but for FHIR purposes, it would be usual
to make more granular updates with individual provenance statements.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="composition-core.html">Clinical Document profile</a> constrains Composition to specify a clinical document
(matching <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">CDA</a>).

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
Composition is a structure for grouping information for purposes of persistence and attestability.  There
are several other grouping structures in FHIR with distinct purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The <a href="list.html">List</a> resource - enumerates a flat collection of resources and provides features for managing the collection.  
While a particular List instance may represent a "snapshot", from a business process perspective, the notion of "list" 
is dynamic â€“ items are added and removed over time.  The List resource references other resources.  Lists may be 
curated and have specific business meaning.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="group.html">Group</a> resource - defines a group of specific people, animals, devices, etc. by enumerating them, 
or by describing qualities that group members have. The Group resource refers to other resources, possibly implicitly.  
Groups are intended to be acted upon or observed as a whole (e.g., performing therapy on a group, calculating risk for a group, 
etc.).  This resource will commonly be used for public health (e.g., describing an at-risk population), clinical trials (e.g., 
defining a test subject pool) and similar purposes.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="bundle.html">Bundle</a> resource - is an infrastructure container for a group of resources.  It does not have narrative 
and is used to group collections of resources for transmission, persistence or processing (e.g., messages, documents, transactions, 
query responses, etc.).  The content of bundles is typically algorithmically determined for a particular exchange or persistence purpose.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="composition.html">Composition</a> resource - defines a set of healthcare-related information that is assembled 
together into a single logical document that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and 
that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement. The Composition resource provides the basic structure 
of a FHIR <a href="documents.html">document</a>.  The full content of the document is expressed using a <a href="bundle.html">Bundle</a> 
containing the Composition and its entries. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Composition resource organizes clinical and administrative content into sections, each of which contains a narrative, 
and references other resources for supporting data. The narrative content of the various sections in a Composition are 
supported by the resources referenced in the section entries.  The complete set of content to make up a document includes 
the Composition resource together with various resources pointed to or indirectly
connected to the Composition. See the <a href="documents.html">FHIR Documents</a> documentation for guidance on how a Composition 
is used when creating a document bundle.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<a name="status"></a>
<h3>Composition Status Codes</h3>
<p>
Every composition has a status element, which describes the status of the content of the composition, taken from this list of codes:
</p>
<%codelist http://hl7.org/fhir/composition-status%>

<p>
Composition status generally only moves down through this list - it moves from <code>registered</code> or <code>preliminary</code> to <code>final</code> and then it may progress to <code>amended</code>. 
Note that in many workflows, only <code>final</code> compositions are made available and the <code>preliminary</code> status is not used. 
</p>
<p>
A very few compositions are created entirely in error in the workflow - usually the composition concerns the wrong patient or is written by the wrong author,
and the error is only detected after the composition has been used or documents have been derived from it. To support resolution of this case, 
the composition is updated to be marked as <code>entered-in-error</code> and a new derived document can be created. This means that the entire series of derived 
documents is now considered to be created in error and systems receiving derived documents based on retracted compositions
SHOULD remove data taken from earlier documents from routine use and/or take other appropriate actions. Systems are not required to 
provide this workflow or support documents derived from retracted compositions, but they SHALL NOT ignore a status of <code>entered-in-error</code>. 
Note that systems that handle compositions or derived documents and don't support the error status need to define 
some other way of handling compositions that are created in error; while this is not a common occurrence, some clinical systems 
have no provision for removing erroneous information from a patient's record, and there is no way for a user to know that it is not fit for use -
this is not safe.

<h3>Note for CDA aware readers</h3>

<p>
Many users of this specification are familiar with the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">Clinical Document Architecture</a> (CDA) and related specifications.
CDA is a primary design input to the Composition resource (other principal inputs are other HL7 document specifications and EN13606). There are three important structural 
differences between CDA and the Composition resource:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A composition is a logical construct - its <code>identifier</code> matches to the CDA <code>ClinicalDocument.setId</code>. 
 Composition resources are wrapped into <a href="documents.html">Document</a> structures, for exchange
 of the whole package (the composition and its parts), and this wrapped, sealed entity is equivalent to a CDA document, 
 where the where the <code>Bundle.identifier</code> is equivalent to <code>ClinicalDocument.id</code> and <code>Bundle.meta.security</code> is equivalent to <code>ClinicalDocument.confidentialityCode</code>.</li>
 <li>The composition section defines a section (or sub-section) of the document, but unlike CDA, the section entries are 
   actually references to other <a href="resourcelist.html">resources</a> that hold the supporting data content for the section. 
   This design means that the data can be reused in many other ways. 
   </li>
  <li>Unlike CDA, the context defined in the <code>Composition</code> (the subject, author, event, event period and encounter) apply to the composition and do not specifically apply to the resources referenced from 
  the <code>section.entry</code>. There is no context flow model in FHIR, so each resource referenced from 
  within a <code>Composition</code> expresses its own individual context.  In this way, clinical content can 
  safely be extracted from the composition.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, note that both the code lists (e.g., <a href="valueset-composition-status.html">Composition.status</a>) and the Composition resource are <a href="composition-mappings.html">mapped</a> to <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=186">HL7 v3</a> and/or CDA.
