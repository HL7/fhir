<h2>
Notes:
</h2>
<ul> 
 <li>The author and the attester are often the same person, but this may not be the case in some clinical workflows</li>
 <li>The attester attests contents of the document resource, the subject resource and the resources referred to 
   in the Composition.section.content references. Because documents are often derived Compositions and the attestation
   from the composition is held to apply to the document, the method for <a href="documents.html#presentation">presenting a document</a>
   should be used when/if attesters review the content of the composition
   </li>
 <li>The custodian is responsible for the maintenance of the composition and any documents derived from it. With regard to the documents, they are 
   responsible for the policy regarding persistence of the documents. Although they need not actually retain a copy of the document, they SHOULD do so.
 </li>
 <li>Narrative only sections can be created by setting Content to a resource of the appropriate type and only populating the 
   <a href="narrative.html">narrative</a> portion of the resource.  If the meaning of the section is such that an appropriate resource does not
   exist, the <a href="other.html">Other</a> resource should be used.  (In some cases, the a resource may have mandatory elements that preclude the
   resource containing only narrative.  This will be addressed in a future release, but for now, <a href="other.html">Other</a> should be used in
   these circumstances as well.)</li>
</ul>
