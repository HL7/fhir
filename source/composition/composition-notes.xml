Notes:

<ul> 
 <li>The author and the attester are often the same person, but this may not be the case in some clinical workflows</li>
 <li>The attester attests contents of the document resource, the subject resource and the resources referred to 
   in the Composition.section.content references. Because documents are often derived Compositions and the attestation
   from the composition is held to apply to the document, the method use for <a href="documents.html#presentation">presenting a document</a>
   should be used when/if attesters review the content of the composition
   </li>
 <li>The custodian is responsible for the maintenance of the composition and any documents derived from it. With regard to the documents, they are 
   responsible for the policy regarding persistence of the documents. They need not actually retain a copy of the document, but they SHOULD do so.
