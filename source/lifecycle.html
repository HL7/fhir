    This page describes several issues around lifecycle management for
    the resources and the content they contain. Specifically, this page
    describes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#status">Resource Status</a>: how resource status codes work</li>
    <li><a href="#current">Current List</a>: issues associated with retrieving "current X list" of resources</li>
    <li><a href="#error">Entered in Error</a>: information about how erroneous entry is handled for the resources</li>
  </ul>

  <a name="status"></a>
  <h3>Resource Status</h3>

  <p>Many FHIR resources have a status element that represents the lifecycle state of the resource or the clinical
    process represented by the resource. Work groups can specify status values appropriate to the individual resource.
    Although consistency between resources is not the primary objective, it is helpful to users and developers to have
    well-crafted value sets that cover all possible states (since the value sets are typically required and
    non-extensible).</p>

  <p>To understand existing status elements, and to help create extensions and resources involving resource states, we
    note that status value sets follow one of the following life cycles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clinical workflow process life cycle</li>
    <li>Request/Order life cycle</li>
    <li>Entity status life cycle</li>
    <li>Clinical status life cycle</li>
  </ul>

  <p>

  <h4>Clinical Workflow Process Life Cycle</h4>

  <p>Describes the lifecycle states of complex activities common in healthcare. Typically, these states follow a
    chronological life cycle that leads from initiation to the conclusion of the action.
    A characteristic (but non-exhaustive) set of states for the clinical workflow process life cycle include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>planned - resources for the activity are being allocated but the activity has not begun</li>
    <li>cancelled - the planned activity did not start and will not take place</li>
    <li>in-progress - the activity has begun</li>
    <li>on-hold (suspended) - the activity has been temporarily interrupted</li>
    <li>stopped (aborted, failed) - the activity has not been completed but no future action is planned</li>
    <li>completed (finished) - the activity has been completed</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Examples of the clinical workflow life cycle:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="communication-definitions.html#Communication.status">Communication.status</a>: <%sclist Communication.status%>
    </li>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <a name="order"></a>

  <h4>Request/Order Life Cycle</h4>

  <p>Some resources in FHIR represent orders or requests. The request lifecycle can be generalized in terms of four
    stages: creating the request, sending the request, receiving acceptance or refusal of the request, and fulfillment
    of the request. A characteristic (but non-exhaustive) set of states for the request/order pattern include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>proposed: An actor (e.g. a clinical decision support system) has proposed an action to be requested</li>
    <li>draft: The request is in preliminary form, prior to being requested</li>
    <li>requested: The request has been made</li>
    <li>rejected: The request receiver has declined the request</li>
    <li>accepted: The request receiver has accepted the request</li>
    <li>in-progress: Work to fulfill the request has begun</li>
    <li>on-hold (suspended): Work on the request has been interrupted</li>
    <li>stopped (aborted): The activity has not been completed but no future action is planned</li>
    <li>completed: Work on the requested task has been completed, and no further action is required</li>
    <li>cancelled: The request has been withdrawn</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Examples of the request/order life cycle:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="communicationrequest-definitions.html#CommunicationRequest.status">CommunicationRequest.status</a>:
      <%sclist CommunicationRequest.status%>
    </li>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <a name="entity"></a>
  <h4>Entity Availability Life Cycle</h4>

  <p>The entity availability life cycle indicates if the resource, or the entity described by the resource, is ready for
    use, not yet ready for use, or has been retired from use. A characteristic (but non-exhaustive) set of states for
    the entity availability life cycle include: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>draft: The entity is being prepared but is not yet in use</li>
    <li>active: The entity is in use</li>
    <li>suspended: The entity is not in use at the moment, but may return to active status</li>
    <li>amended: The entity has undergone a revision but is still active</li>
    <li>retired (superseded): The entity is no longer in use.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Examples of the entity availability life cycle:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="diagnosticreport-definitions.html#DiagnosticReport.status">DiagnosticReport.status</a>: <%sclist DiagnosticReport.status%>
    </li>
    <li><a href="medicationstatement-definitions.html#MedicationStatement.status">MedicationStatement.status</a>: <%sclist MedicationStatement.status%>. (note: in-progress and completed are states reflecting
        the administration of the medication)</li>

      <%sclist CapabilityStatement.status%>

  <h4>Clinical Status Life Cycle</h4>
  <p>Clinical status is somewhat different than the previous status values, since it does not deal with workflow or
    lifecycle. Instead, it indicates how evidence is affecting a clinical interpretation. Here are two examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a
        href="allergyintolerance-definitions.html#AllergyIntolerance.clinicalStatus">AllergyIntolerance.clinicalStatus</a>:
      <%sclist AllergyIntolerance.clinicalStatus%>
    </li>
    <li><a href="condition-definitions.html#Condition.clinicalStatus">Condition.clinicalStatus</a>: <%sclist Condition.clinicalStatus%>
    </li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Current Resource Lists</h3>

  <p>
    The section regarding current lists has been removed due to lack of implementation experience and feedback. 
    If there is continued interest in this topic, it may be reintroduced in the <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/api-incubator">API Incubator</a>.
  </p>
  
  <hr />
  <a name="error"></a>
  <h3>Entered in Error Summary</h3>

  <p>
    The entered-in-error state indicates the resource was created accidentally and
    should be ignored. This state can apply to resources created by manual
    entry. It is usually not associated with the Clinical Workflow Process life cycle,
    but can be associated with the Request/Order and the Entity Availability life cycles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Handling of erroneous data is tightly tied to business processes and thus there are no generic rules for 
    what to do when data is flagged as erroneous.  Implementation Guides may define additional guidance about 
    what actions should be taken, such as data redaction, sending of notifications, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    This table summarizes what is expected to happen for each resource in the case
    that the data it contains is subsequently found to be an erroneous entry.
  </p>

  [%enteredInErrorTable%]

  <p>
    Note: Resources that are not listed in this table do not have any explicit documentation with regard to being
    entered in error.
