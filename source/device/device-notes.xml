<h3>Device Identifiers</h3>

<p>
Nearly all devices are assigned one or more identifiers, which are usually printed or affixed to the device using either barcodes or rfids. 
The identifiers can come from the manufacturer (often called the "serial number", various institution and registries. Any of 
these identifiers assigned to the device can and should be recorded in the device resource. The different identifiers are 
differentiated by their use, label, and system values.
</p>
<p>
The most important of the identifiers is the 
<a href="http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/UniqueDeviceIdentification/default.htm">Unique Device Identifier</a>
(UDI), which most medical devices are required to carry and which can be used to access the 
<a href="http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/UniqueDeviceIdentification/GlobalUDIDatabaseGUDID/ucm20038750.htm">Global 
Unique Device Identification Database</a> (GUDID). The UDI has it's own element (<i>udi</i>). The UDI may identify an instance of a device uniquely, or it may just identify the type of the device. 
A portion of the UDI - the DI part - can be extracted from the UDI when required, and used 
to look up information about the device through the GUDID.
Where the device has an assigned UDI, the other details carried in the resource (lot, expiry date etc) must be 
consistent with the information encoded  in the UDI or reigstered in the GUDID.
