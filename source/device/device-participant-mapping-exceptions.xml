It is best practice for the identifier to only appear on a single resource instance, however business practices may occasionally dictate that multiple resource instances with the same identifier can exist - possibly even with different resource types.  For example, multiple Patient and a Person resource instance might share the same social insurance number."/>
            <resource value="Certain attributes, like serial number and UDI Carrier (the HRF or AIDC barcode string) are not device instance identifiers as they are not consistently able to uniquely identify the instance of a device, thus are not appropriate to be used to value Device.identifier. The barcode string from a barcode present on a device label or package may identify the instance, include names given to the device in local usage, or may identify the type of device. If the identifier identifies the type of device, Device.type element should be used. The identifier is typically valued if the serialNumber or lotNumber is not valued and represents a different type of identifier.  However, it is permissible to still include those identifiers in DeviceDefinition.identifier with the appropriate identifier.type."/>
