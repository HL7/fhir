<p>
 This resource identifies an instance of a manufactured thing that is used in the provision of healthcare without being substantially changed through that activity. The device may be a machine, an insert, a computer, an application, etc. This includes durable (reusable) medical equipment as well as disposable equipment used for diagnostic, treatment, and research for healthcare and public health. 
 
 Primarily used for recording which device performed an action and can also be used to track device location. Can also be used for prescribing and dispensing devices for patient use. 
</p>

<p>
There are 4 device related resources
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Device (this resource) - an administrative resource that tracks individual devices and their location. Primarily used for attribution of actions to devices</li>
 <li><a href="devicecapabilities.htm">Device Capabilities</a> - Defines what observations a device will provide when another device connects to it</li>
 <li><a href="devicelog.htm">Device Log</a> - A raw report from a device at a point in time. Must be paired with the correct Device Capabilities resource in order to be processed</li>
 <li><a href="deviceobservation.htm">Device Observation</a> - A report of observations from a device</li>
</ul>
<p>
The device capabilities and log resources are used when communicating with a device, either directly or indirectly. 
When a channel is opened with the device, or its proxy, it first sends the Capabilities resource, and then a 
series of log resources. The FHIR JSON format is used in this case. 
</p>
<p>
The application that receives the log resources may choose to merge the log with the capabilities 
statement to create a device observation, which is suitable for wider use within a EHR/Clinical record context.
