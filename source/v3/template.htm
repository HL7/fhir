<h1>HL7 Version 3 Namespaces (Code Systems and Value Sets)</h1>

<p>
These namespaces are defined for use in FHIR. Code Systems are used 
when representing codes that were defined as part of the v3 code systems. 
So if you are representing the code "M" from
the code system AdministrativeGender in a FHIR instance, then you would use 
the system "http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/AdministrativeGender" (note that the namespace
is case sensitive).
</p>
<p>
Value Set namespaces are used as part of the specification itself, or in 
Profiles or other Value Sets where v3 code systems are used.
</p>
<p>
All of these namespaces are subject to further change.
</p>
