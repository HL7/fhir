<h2>License and Legal Terms</h2>
<a name="disclaimer"></a>
<h3>Disclaimer and Warning of Use</h3>
<p>
FHIR Resource definitions developed by HL7 are derived from the considerable collective 
experience of the HL7 membership and wide community feedback from the development and 
application of a spectrum of health care interoperability solutions.  However, Resource 
definitions are generalized to support multiple contexts of use. It is the responsibility 
of the persons or organizations using these Resources to ensure their use is fit for the 
particular purpose in which they are used, including validation for clinical and operational use.

<h3>FHIR License</h3>
<p>
FHIR plain English license:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>FHIR is &copy; and &reg; HL7. The right to maintain FHIR remains vested in HL7</li>
 <li>You can redistribute FHIR</li>
 <li>You can create derivative specifications or implementation-related products and services</li>
 <li>Derivative Specifications cannot redefine what conformance to FHIR means</li>
 <li>You can't claim that HL7 or any of its members endorses your derived [thing] because it uses content from this specification</li>
 <li>Neither HL7 nor any of the contributors to this specification accept any liability for your use of FHIR</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note: Why not use a standard open source license? We'd like to use <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> or 
<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">a license listed here</a>, but none of them actually deliver on 
the plain English intent above in important ways because they are suitable for software, not standards. 
We aspire to meet <a href="http://opensource.org/osr-intro">these requirements from the Open Source Initiative</a>, 
though <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/patents.html">patents are a problem</a>. 
</p>
<p>
While we resolve the questions around the long term license, the following license,
adapted from the <a href="http://www.omg.org">OMG</a> (thanks for allowing this), applies:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Subject to all of the terms and conditions below, HL7 hereby grants you a fully-paid up, 
non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual, worldwide license (without the right to 
sublicense) to use this specification to create and distribute software and derivative
works that are based upon this specification and to use, copy and 
distribute this specification as provided under the United States Copyright Act; provided that: 
</p>
<ol>
 <li>both the copyright notice identified above and this permission notice appear on any copies of this specification; </li>
 <li>the use of the specifications is for informational purposes and will not be resold or transferred for commercial purposes; </li> 
 <li>no modifications are made to this specification. </li>
</ol>
<p> 
This limited permission automatically terminates without notice if you breach any of 
these terms or conditions. Upon termination, you will destroy immediately any copies 
of the specifications in your possession or control. 
</p>
<h3>DEFINITION OF THIS SPECIFICATION</h3>
<p>
For the purposes of this license, "This specification" means the content 
found at http://hl7.org/fhir, and also available from there for 
redistribution, where the content claims to actually be the FHIR specification. 
Any work that copies content from this specification, but does not make this 
claim, irrespective of the percentage of content that is quoted or derived 
from this specification itself, is considered to be a derivative work.
</p>
<h3>GENERAL USE RESTRICTIONS</h3>
<p>
Any unauthorized use of this specification may violate copyright laws, trademark laws, and communications 
regulations and statutes. This document contains information which is protected by copyright. All Rights 
Reserved. No part of this work covered by copyright herein may be reproduced or used in any form or by 
any means--graphic, electronic, or mechanical, including photocopying, recording, taping, or information 
storage and retrieval systems--without permission of the copyright owner.
</p>
<h3>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY</h3>
<p>
WHILE THIS PUBLICATION IS BELIEVED TO BE ACCURATE, IT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND MAY CONTAIN ERRORS OR 
MISPRINTS. HL7 MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH REGARD TO THIS PUBLICATION, 
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE OR OWNERSHIP, IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR 
WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE. IN NO EVENT SHALL HL7  BE LIABLE FOR ERRORS 
CONTAINED HEREIN OR FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, RELIANCE OR COVER 
DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR USE, INCURRED BY ANY USER OR ANY THIRD PARTY 
IN CONNECTION WITH THE FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE, OR USE OF THIS MATERIAL, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
</p>
<p>
The entire risk as to the quality and performance of software developed using this specification is 
borne by you. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of the license granted to 
you to use this specification.
</p>
<h3>CONFORMANCE</h3>
<p>
HL7 is and shall at all times be the sole entity that may authorize developers, suppliers and 
sellers of computer software or specifications to use certification marks, trademarks or other 
special designations to indicate compliance with FHIR. Software developed under the 
terms of this license may claim compliance or conformance with FHIR if and only 
if the software compliance is of a nature fully matching the applicable conformance points as 
stated in the FHIR specification. Software developed only partially matching the applicable 
compliance points may claim only that the software was based on FHIR, but may 
not claim compliance or conformance with this specification. In the event that testing suites 
or processes are implemented or approved by HL7, Inc., software developed using this 
specification may claim compliance or conformance with the FHIR specification only if the 
software satisfactorily completes the testing suites.
