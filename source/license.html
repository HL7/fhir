<h3>Disclaimer and Warning of Use</h3>
<p>
FHIR Resource definitions developed by HL7 are derived from the considerable collective 
experience of the HL7 membership and wide community feedback from the development and 
application of a spectrum of health care interoperability solutions.  However, Resource 
definitions are generalized to support multiple contexts of use. It is the responsibility 
of the persons or organizations using these Resources to ensure their use is fit for the 
particular purpose in which they are used, including validation for clinical and operational use.
