<h1>HL7 Version 2 Table Namespaces</h1>

<p>
These system namespaces are defined for use in FHIR when 
representing codes that were defined as part of the v2 tables 
in FHIR instances. So if you are representing the code "M" from
table 0001 in HL7 v2.3.1 in a FHIR instance, then you would use 
the system "http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0001".
</p>
<p>
There are a number of subtle but serious issues with using 
tables defined for v2 as code systems, so some of these 
tables are mapped to a different namespace for each version.
Note that even when multiple versions are mapped to the same
namespace, there are additional underlying issues that mean
that there are different formal code systems for different
versions.
</p>
<p>
All of these namespaces are subject to further change as 
additional review of the v2 tables proceeds.
