<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The audit event is based on the <a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-9.html">IHE-ATNA Audit record definitions</a>, originally from <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3881">RFC 3881</a>, and now managed by
DICOM (see <a href="http://medical.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part15.html#sect_A.5">DICOM Part 15 Annex A5</a>). 
</p>
<ul>
<li>ASTM E2147 - Setup the concept of security audit logs for healthcare including accounting of disclosures</li>
<li>IETF RFC 3881 - Defined the Information Model (IETF rule forced this to be informative)</li>
<li>DICOM Audit Log Message - Made the information model Normative, defined Vocabulary, Transport Binding, and Schema</li>
<li>IHE ATNA - Defines the grouping with secure transport and access controls; and defined specific audit log records for specific IHE transactions.</li>
<li>NIST SP800-92 - Shows how to do audit log management and reporting - consistent with our model</li>
<li>HL7 PASS - Defined an Audit Service with responsibilities and a query interface for reporting use</li>
<li>ISO 27789 - Defined the subset of audit events that an EHR would need </li>

This resource is managed collaboratively between HL7, DICOM, and IHE.

<p>
A record of an event relevant for purposes such as operations, privacy, security, maintenance, and performance analysis.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
All actors - such as applications, processes, and services - involved in an auditable event SHOULD record an AuditEvent. 
This will likely result in multiple AuditEvent entries that show whether privacy and security 
safeguards, such as access control, are properly functioning across an enterprise's system-of-systems. 
Thus, it is typical to get an auditable event recorded by both the application in a workflow process and the servers that support them. 
For this reason, duplicate entries are expected, which is helpful because it MAY aid in the detection of 
security, privacy, or other operational problems. For example, 
fewer than expected actors being recorded in a multi-actor process or attributes related to those records being in 
conflict, which is an indication of a security problem.
There MAY be non-participating actors, such as trusted intermediary, that also detect a security, privacy, or operational relevant event and thus would record an AuditEvent.
</p>
<p>
Security relevant events are not limited to communications or RESTful events. They include: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>software start-up and shutdown;</li>
<li>user login and logout; </li>
<li>access control decisions; </li>
<li>configuration events; </li>
<li>software installation; </li>
<li>policy rules changes; and </li>
<li>manipulation of data that exposes the data to users. </li>
</ul>
<p>
See the 
<a href="valueset-audit-event-type-example.html">Audit Event Category</a> vocabulary for guidance on some security relevant event categories.
</p>
<p>
The AuditEvent resource holds the details of an event in terms of who, what, where, when, and why. 
Where the identification of the who participated is the agent. 
An agent can be a person, an organization, software, device, or other actors that MAY be ascribed responsibility.  
What objects were used/created/updated is recorded as the entity. 
An entity is an identifiable physical, digital, conceptual or other kind of thing; entities MAY be real or imaginary.
</p>
<p>
    The content of an AuditEvent is primarily intended for administrative use; used by security system administrators, security and privacy information managers, records management personnel, etc. 
    The AuditEvent MAY also inform the Patient about uses of their data.  
    This content can be accessible or used directly by other healthcare users, such as providers or patients for gaining insight into who and what has been done. 
    The AuditEvent record includes very sensitive information so access to the AuditEvent would be highly privileged and controlled. 
    For example, when providing AuditEvent to a patient the data feed would be limited to the Patient compartment, and the content MAY be subsetted or masked in order to meet privacy needs. 
    The AuditEvent record is not intended to replace other audit logs, but rather used to enhance them, or to be used as an API to many audit logs.
</p>
<p>
Relationship of AuditEvent and Provenance resources are often (though not exclusively) created by the application 
responding to the create/read/query/update/delete/execute etc. event. 
A <a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a> resource contains overlapping 
information, but is a record-keeping assertion that gathers information about the context in which the information 
in a resource "came to be" in its current state, e.g., whether it was created de novo or obtained from another entity 
in whole, part, or by transformation. Provenance resources are prepared by the application that initiates the 
create/update of the resource and MAY be persisted with the AuditEvent target resource.
