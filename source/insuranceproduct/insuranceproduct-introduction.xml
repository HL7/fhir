<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
    Insurance offerings will be fully described by the combination of both InsurancePlan (the costs) and InsuranceProduct (the benefits). A given payer’s products typically differ by network type and/or coverage benefits.
</p>
<p>
    An <a href="insuranceplan.html">InsurancePlan</a> pairs the health insurance coverage benefits under an InsuranceProduct with the particular cost sharing structure offered to a consumer. A given InsuranceProduct may comprise multiple InsurancePlans.
