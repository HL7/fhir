<h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>
Each resource may include a human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, 
and may be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. 
If narrative is present, it SHALL reflect all content needed for a human to understand the 
essential clinical and business information otherwise encoded within the resource. 
Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
</p>
<p>
The narrative for a resource is allowed to contain additional information that is not in 
the structured data, including human-edited content. Such additional information SHALL be 
in the scope of the definition of the resource, though it is common for the narrative to
include additional descriptional information extracted from other referenced resources.
</p>
<p>
While resources SHOULD always contain narrative, so that to support human-consumption
as a fallback, in a strictly managed trading systems where all systems share a common 
data model, and additional text is unnecessary or even a clinical safety risk, the 
narrative may be omitted. However implementers should consider carefully before 
doing this, as it will mean that these resources can only be understood in the 
limited trading environment, and closed trading partner environments are very likely 
to open up during the lifetime of the resources they define.
</p>
<p>
Note that <a href="references.htm#contained">Contained</a> Resources SHALL NOT have a narrative 
of their own.
</p>
<p>
The narrative is an xhtml fragment that also includes images if appropriate:
</p>
[%dt Narrative%]
<p>
The contents of the <i>div</i> element are an XHTML fragment containing only the basic html formatting elements described in 
chapters 7-11 (except section 4 of chapter 9) and 15 of the HTML 4.0 standard, &lt;a&gt; elements (either name or href),
images and internally contained style attributes. The XHTML content SHALL not contain
a head, a body element, external stylesheet references, scripts, forms, base/link/xlink, frames, iframes,
and objects. The div element SHALL have some non-whitespace content.
<!-- Todo: Formally encode these constraints in schematron -->
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml" fragment="Narrative">
  &lt;narrative&gt;
    &lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;This is a simple 
          example with only plain text&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/narrative&gt;
   
   &lt;narrative&gt;
   &lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;
       This is an &lt;i&gt;example&lt;/i&gt; with some &lt;b&gt;xhtml&lt;/b&gt; formatting.
     &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/narrative&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The inner portion of the div content is often used for the innerHTML property in a browser.
In order to simplify processing, the narrative SHALL be encoded so that the character content
between the first "&gt;" and the last "&lt;" characters is the content of the &lt;div&gt; element.
</p>
<p>
Note that the XHTML is contained in general XML, and so there is no support for HTML entities
like &amp;nbsp; or &amp;copy; etc. Unicode characters should be used instead. Note that 
&amp;#160; substitutes for &amp;nbsp;. 
</p>
<p>
The narrative content should be in the <a href="base-definitions.htm#Resource.language">language of the resource</a>, but 
there is no reason to expect that HTML type tooling would understand the resource <a href="resources.htm#content">language</a> element. For this reason, 
a lang attribute on the &lt;div&gt; should also be used (and see 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/dom.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes">the note in the HTML 5 specification about use of language</a>).
</p>

<p>
The image source references may be a local reference within the resource:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;img src="#a5"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This is an <a href="references.htm#idref">internal reference</a> to an id attribute on an element in the same resource, 
either an element of type "<a href="datatypes.htm#Attachment">Attachment</a>", or a contained <a href="http.htm#binary">Binary</a> resource.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml">
&lt;Patient xmlns=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir&quot;&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;
    &lt;status value=&quot;generated&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;... &lt;img src=&quot;#pic1&quot;/&gt;. ....&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;contained&gt;
    &lt;Binary id=&quot;pic1&quot; contentType=&quot;image/gif&quot;&gt;MEKH....SD/Z&lt;/Binary&gt;
  &lt;/contained&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Since the availability of images that are not contained in the resource is not guaranteed, 
when the resource is presented to a user, the source for any images that are an essential 
part of the narrative should always be embedded in an attachment or a contained resource.
</p>

<a name="css"></a>
<h3>Styling the XHTML</h3>
<p>
The XHTML fragment in the narrative may be styled using CSS in the normal fashion, using a mix of classes, ids 
and in-line style elements. Specific CSS stylesheets will be applied to the XHTML when it is extracted from
the resource to be displayed to a human to create the presentation desired in the context of use. Authors
may fix the following styling aspects of the content:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>bold, italic, underline, strikethrough</li>
  <li>font color, family, and size</li>
  <li>background color, text alignment</li>
  <li>whitespace interpretation</li>
  <li>ordered list number format (since it may be referred to in text)</li>
</ul>
<p>
These style properties are specified in-line using the style attribute. If an equivalent 
html element exists, such as "i", or "pre", it may be used instead, but note that some of these 
elements are deprecated in HTML 4 and SHALL not be used in Narrative XHTML (including "u", and "font").
</p>
<p>
Rendering systems are required to respect any of these rendering styles when they are specified in 
the XHTML, though appropriate interpretation is allowed (e.g. a low-contrast display for dark 
room contexts or a high-contrast display for the visually impaired may adjust colors accordingly). 
</p>
<p>
Authors are allowed to specify additional styles and style properties as specified in the CSS specification,
but these are extensions to this specification and renderers are not required to honor them. Note, however,
the additional rules around styling that apply in the context of <a href="document.htm#css">documents</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note: styles in resources can make use of the styles defined in the standard FHIR stylesheet, which
lives here: <a href="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/fhir.css">http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/fhir.css</a>.
Since this stylesheet is not referred to directly, rendering systems may take their own copy if they wish. 
Authoring systems should not depend on these styles being supported in order to render clinical content correctly without
trading partner agreement.
