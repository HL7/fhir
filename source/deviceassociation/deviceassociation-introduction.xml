<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>Device Association records the relationship between a device and a subject and/or operator. The relationsip may be as the owner, patient, operator or cusodian of the device. The scope covers all devices including, but not limited to: implantables, wheelchairs, RTLS, personal health and point of care devices, diagnostic, imaging and durable medical equipment. This resource is intended to apply to any delivery environment and discipline where a device association is useful to record.</p>
<p>The subjects may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patient</strong> - the following are often associated with a specific patient: implantables, prosthetics, activity trackers, mobility assistance, care monitoring, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Group</strong> - some devices may be associated with a family group or treatment group. For example a weight scale or blood pressure cuff.</li>
<li><strong>Practitioner</strong> - a device that is associated with the practitioner: pager, alert monitor, cell phone, laptop/tablet</li>
<li><strong>Device</strong> - a device may be associated with another device when it is independent of the focal device.  Note: this is different than the containment tree with parent element in the Device resource. For example a RFID tag used to track the location of a wheelchair.</li>
<li><strong>RelatedPerson</strong> - a device that is associated with another person related to the patient. For example, an alerting device given to a spouse while their partner is in surgery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="device.html">Device</a></strong>  - The device that is, e.g., used, placed in or on, or owned by the subject referenced in the DeviceAssociation.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="deviceusage.html">DeviceUsage</a></strong> and <strong><a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a></strong> - Both Procedure and DeviceUsage can comprehend association (not necessarily the related dissociation) of a device with a subject. They are intended to be used from the patient or process perspective.
        <ul>
            <li>For tracking the act of implanting or using the device, Procedure may be used;</li>
            <li>For updating the patient's information about the usage of a device, DeviceUsage may be used;</li>
            <li>For tracking the different events along the lifecycle of the same Device, DeviceAssociation is appropriate </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>These are not exclusive, i.e. when associating a device with a patient, the it is possible to capture the patient's clinical information with a DeviceUsage resource, include the device in a Procedure for reporting, and keep the Device's traceability information with a DeviceAssociation resource.</p>
<p>To track changes in settings, the Observation resource can be used, where <code>Observation.subject</code> references the Device that the settings apply to.  If, e.g., the patient that the Device is associated with needs to be identified, then the DeviceAssociation where <code>DeviceAssociation.period</code> includes the <code>Observation.effective[x]</code> would have that patient in <code>DeviceAssociation.subject</code>.</p>
