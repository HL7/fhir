This implies a requirement to deal with a choice of either a code or a much more complete resource.<br/>Currently that resource has not been created.</td>

The present MedicationAdministration resource (and the other three yet to be built) link to an Encounter as an identifier, but it may be more appropriate for it to be a full resource.</td>
