    <h3>Medication Administration Record (MAR) Use Case</h3>
    <p>Medication administrations can be done by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>clinician e.g. nurse, physician, other providers</li>
        <li>patient via self-administration</li>
        <li>family member e.g. mother for the baby</li>
        <li>caregiver (non-clinician)</li>
        <li>devices e.g. IV pumps, insulin pumps, patient-controlled analgesic (PCA) pumps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In order to administer a medication, there is often a list of medications that includes the medication itself e.g code or name , dose, date/time the medication is to be administered and route and in some cases additional administration instructions. A common name for this type of list of medications to be administered and the corresponding record of medication administrations is Medication Administration Record (MAR).  </p>
    <h3>Synonyms/Key Definitions</h3>
    <p>Medication Administration Record (MAR) - a view of a patients medications that need to be administered.  Typically, an MAR is seen in settings where there is a requirement to document who, when, what  and where information, concerning medications administered to a patient, or if self-administered, taken by a patient. The same record often has two primary functions - first it lists what medications need to be administered and what date and time or time interval, the administration should be done; and second it lists what medications have been administered and the details associated with the administration.  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scheduled Medication Administration - this represents a specific medication, a dose, or IV rate, a route of administration, a date and time, dosage instructions, and optionally, it may include a time interval
                Use the MedicationRequest resource to represent each individual medication administration</li>

    <h3>Rationale</h3>
    <p>Scheduled Medication Administration information is used to inform the person who will administer the medication(s) the date/time, and medication specific information e.g., dose, route, method, special instructions for each medication a person is scheduled to take. </p>
    
    <p>Recording Medication Administration details provides a place to capture the data about the actual administration e.g., date/time or time interval of administration, dose, route, method, device, performer, etc. </p>
    
    <p>Depending on the type of application, this type of information may be presented to the user who is administering the medication in an EHR module for medication administration, in a mobile application for the patient or caregiver.   </p>
    
    <h3>Setting</h3>
    
    <p>Medication administrations occur in all types of settings e.g. hospitals, outpatient clinics, home, ambulance, ER, etc.  </p>
    
    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>The list of medications to be administered, or that have been administered may be captured in an application on a patient's phone, tablet or computer workstation.</p>
    
    <p>The lists may be created by a variety of users or systems, for example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Patient - direct entry into a mobile app</li>
        <li>Other e.g.  parent for a child, caregiver for a patient</li>
        <li>Electronically e.g., health system auto generates the list from orders/prescriptions known to the system</li>
        <li>Clinician e.g., user entry within an EHR Medication Administration module  </li>
        <li>Output of a process e.g. medication reconciliation; new or updated medication orders (prescriptions, requests)</li>
    </ul>
    
    
   
    
    <p>Data sources for the medications that are listed on the Medication Administration list determine what will be displayed to a user.  Here are two common examples: </p>
    <p> Provider view Medication Administration list may include medications that come from: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prescribed by clinicians who have the authority to write these types of medication orders</li>
        <li>Over-the-counter (OTC) medications that the patient informs/adds to the list - this would include herbals and supplements</li>
        <li>NOTE: Medication errors may lead to medications potentially showing up on a list of medications to be administered e.g., medication order was written for the wrong patient
            In this case, the MAR indicates that a medication should be administered to a patient (later found to be in error e.g., wrong patient)</li>
        <li>NOTE: Medication errors may also lead to medications showing up on a list of administered medications e.g., medication was mistakenly administered to the wrong patient, or the wrong dose was administered, or wrong route was used, etc.  </li>
   

    
    </ul>
    
    <p>Patient view Medication Administration list may include medications that come: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>from an identical list as above with the following caveats:
                <ul>
                    <li>The list might not include some medications if the patient is one of the sources for the list and states they are not taking a specific medication, irrespective of whether it was prescribed </li>
                    
                    <li>The patient does not know or has incomplete memory of the medications they have been prescribed </li>
                    <li>The level of detail for each medication might not be as detailed as provider-based list  </li> 
                    
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
