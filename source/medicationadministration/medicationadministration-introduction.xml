<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
This resource covers the administration of all medications with the exception of vaccines.
It will principally be used within inpatient settings to record the capture of medication administrations including self-administrations of oral medications,
injections, intra-venous adjustments, etc.  It can also be used in out-patient settings to record allergy shots and other non-immunization administrations.  In some
cases it might be used for home-health reporting, such as recording self-administered or even device-administered insulin.

        <td>This is a record of medication being taken by a patient, or that the medication has been given to a patient where the record is the result of a report from the patient, or another clinician. 
          A medication statement is not a part of the prescribe->dispense->administer sequence but is a report that such a sequence (or at least a part of it) did take place resulting in a belief that the patient has received a particular medication.

<p>
<b>MedicationAdministration</b> is intended for tracking the administration of non-vaccine medications.  Administration of vaccines is intended to be handled using the <a href="immunization.html">Immunization</a> resource.    Some systems treat immunizations in the same way as any other medication administration.  Such systems SHOULD use an immunization resource to represent these.  If systems need to use a <b>MedicationAdministration</b> resource to capture vaccinations for workflow or other reasons, they SHOULD also expose an equivalent <a href="immunization.html">Immunization</a> instance.
