    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This module is concerned with "devices" and how to use the various device-related FHIR resources to address common use cases. Within FHIR a "device" can represent a wide range of equipment including such diverse things as MRIs, beds, tongue depressors, bandages, stents and implants, blood pressure monitors, weight scales, infusions pumps, clinical decision support software, continuous glucose monitor, and bed-side monitors. Because of the range of possible devices and the range of uses, systems may choose to implement a subset of device-related resources.</p>

    <p>Device-related resources include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Resources providing the <b>definition and documenting the capabilities</b> of the device include: Device, DeviceDefinition, DeviceMetric</li>
        <li>Resources documenting the <b>supply or clinical workflow</b> (e.g., order, fulfillment, and use) of devices include: DeviceAssociation, DeviceRequest, DeviceDispense, DeviceUsage</li>
        <li>Resources related to the <b>actual clinical use and/or behavior</b> of the device include: Observation, DeviceAlert, Procedure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Device-related FHIR Resources: The Big picture</h4>
    <p>When considering the use of FHIR for the integration of device information and services, many resources may be involved in even the simplest application.  Additionally, given the robust nature of FHIR resources, a single basic capability will have many potential solutions all using valid FHIR resource configurations.  The following diagram captures some of the key device-related FHIR resources and representative relationships.  It is recommended that readers review the respective resources for all valid relationships.</p>
    <img src="DeviceModule.svg" alt="Image showing the Device-related FHIR Resources: The Big picture" width=1000/>

    <p>Looking in to the details of each of the resources on this diagram, though, will reveal a significant amount of detail that can often lead to confusion as to the high-level purposes they are intended to address.  Only the most comprehensive applications will require integration of all the model components.  Most will require only a subset. To sort this out, the following examples are provided to help understand the key concepts and rationale for their implementation.</p>

    <a name="deviceinstancevstype"></a>
    <p><b><u>Device Instance vs. Device Type</u></b></p>
    <p><b>Resources:</b><a href="device.html">Device</a>, <a href="devicedefinition.html">Device Definition</a></p>

    <p>When working with a specific <b>INSTANCE</b> of a device (that can be uniquely identified for example: Company Z Super Ventilator, model SV, serial #123xyz456), a <a href="device.html">Device</a> resource is used. A <a href="device.html">Device</a> may reference a single <a href="devicedefinition.html">DeviceDefinition</a> when additional definitional information about the device is necessary to exchange.</p>

    <p><b><u>What about device settings vs. "observations"?</u></b></p>
    <p><b>Resources:</b><a href="device.html">Device</a>, <a href="devicemetric.html">Device Metric</a>, <a href="observation.html">Observation</a></p>
    <p><b>Description:</b>  The DeviceMetric models the properties of the Observations generated by the device, whereas the Observation is recording the measurement taken by the device.</p>
    <p><b>Examples</b>: TBD - Personal Health Device examples</p>

    <h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
    <p>The Device-related resources typically represent patient-specific data, and as such are susceptible to data breaching. Necessary privacy and security provisions must be in place when searching and fetching this information. For more general considerations, see the <a href="secpriv-module.html">the Security and Privacy module</a>.</p>
    <P>Device data must be treated securely across all three aspects that include confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Furthermore, proper confidentiality, integrity and availability protections must be applied across the entire ecosystem that delivers the data from the device to personal health or point of care services. Device data privacy must also be considered to ensure that patient identifiable data is not compromised and made public. The ecosystem delivering the device data must not publicly associate device data with the patient or user to which that data belongs. In addition, access to device data must be restricted to those who need to know in clinical and consumer settings and to those who are allowed access by the user or patient.</P>
    <p>It is highly recommended that a proper methodology is used to assess the security vulnerabilities and associated threats of any such architecture and to apply proper mitigation techniques based on the risks exposed by such threats. To that end, it is recommended that security methods are constructed based on the <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/11073-40101/7668/">IEEE 11073-40101</a> and <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/11073-40102/7680/">IEEE 11073-40102</a> standards that provide the framework for device cybersecurity vulnerability analysis and risk mitigation. Such analysis will enable application of transport-specific mitigation techniques such as the Bluetooth Authorization Control <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/authorization-control-service-1-0/">Service</a> and <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/authorization-control-profile-1-0/">Profile</a> specifications.</p>
