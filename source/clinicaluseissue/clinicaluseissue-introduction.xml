		<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
		<p>
			The ClinicalUseIssue resource is designed to represent definitional facts about the potential use of a medication.
		</p>
		<p>
			These may be used when submitting a product dossier to regulators, as part of an electronic medication knowledge base, or directly during
			decision support activities.
		</p>
		<p>
			The clinical issues don't refer to any actual instance of the medication being used, or to any actual patient event. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The resource is used to record one instance of one of these: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Indication - A medical situation in which a medicinal product is appropriate for use</li>
			<li>Contraindication - A reason why a medicinal product is not to be used in a certain context</li>
			<li>Interaction - The interactions of the medicinal product with other medicinal products, food, substances etc.</li>
			<li>Undesirable Effect - A potential negative outcome from the use of a medicinal product. See also AdverseEvent, which is for actual events (or near misses), and AllergyIntolerance.</li>
		</ul>
