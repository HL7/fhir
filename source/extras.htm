<h2>Tags, Bundles, Compartments</h2>

<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>
In addition to the basic contents of Resources, and their metadata, each resource can be labelled
with one or more "Tags". These tags can be used to associate additional operational information 
with the Resources, including defining security labels used in access control policies, workflow
management, and other uses. Tags are attached to resources, and exchanged with their resource.
Tags are never used to keep information that needs to be understood when interpreting the content
of a resource; their function is limited to finding and controlling access to the resource.
</p>
<p>
Each tag has two properties:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>URI : uri</td><td>A term that defines the meaning of the tag</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Label : string</td><td>(Optional) A human-readable label for the tag for use when displaying in end-user applications</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The URI may be a reference to a healthcare vocabulary, including ones defined in this specification,
such as the basic <a href="security.htm#labels">security label set</a>, or vocabularies such as 
those defined by HL7 (v2 and v3/CDA), LOINC, or SNOMED-CT. Alternatively, the URI may be one
defined by the implementation in the local context. Literal references that refer directly 
to a description of the tag (typically just an HTML page) are preferred over symbolic references 
but this is not required.
</p>
<p>
If the end user application provides functionality to the user that allows the user to 
affix arbitrary text tags to the resource for their own purpose, the application can 
automatically construct a URI by appending the mime encoding of the Label to the base
URL "http://hl7.org/fhir/tags/text/". When applications processing resources see this
base URL, they can automatically know that this is a pure text label with no formal
meaning.

<h3>Compartments</h3>
<p>
Each resource may belong to one or more logical compartments. A compartment is a logical 
grouping of resources which share a common property. Compartments have two principal roles:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Function as an access mechanism for finding a set of related resources quickly</li>
 <li>Provide a definitional basis for applying access control to resources quickly</li>
</ul>
<p>
Compartments define how particular instances of the compartment are defined and identified,
and how systems know whether resources are in the compartment or not. Here is a list of 
the compartments defined by this specification:
</p>
<%compartmentlist%>
<p>
As an example of compartment usage, to retrieve a list of a patient's conditions, use the URL:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [baseurl]/patient/@[id]/condition
</pre>
<p>
The details of this usage are <a href="http.htm#search">described under the search operation</a>.
</p>
<p>
Compartments may be used explicitly, like this, but can also be used implicitly. For instance,
if a FHIR server is providing a patient view of a record, the authorised user associated
with use of the FHIR RESTful api may be limited to accessing records from the
compartment instance(s) logically associated with their identity.
</p>
<p>
Note that resources may cross between compartments, or interlink them. Examples of 
this would be where a <a href="diagnosticreport.htm">Diagnostic Report</a> identifies  
a subject, but an <a href="observation.htm">Observation</a> it references identifies
a different subject, or where a <a href="list.htm">List</a> resource references
items that identify different subjects. Such cross-linking may arise for 
many valid reasons, including:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Cases where subject records are inter-linked - Transplants, Perinatal care, family therapy etc.</li>
 <li>Workflow management where action lists link multiple patients and/or practitioners</li>
</ul>
<p>
Given the wide variety of use cases and contexts in which FHIR is used, compartments 
do not define how cross-linking is handled. Systems may reject resources, remove them 
from both compartments, or place them in both, or act in some other fashion.

<h3>Resource Bundles</h3>
<p>
One common operation performed with resources is to gather a collection of resources into a single instance.
In FHIR this is referred to as "bundling" the resources together. The resource bundle is not just a list of 
references to resources, but includes their whole content. These resource bundles are useful for a variety of 
different reasons, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Returning a set of resources that meet some criteria as part of a server operation</li>
  <li>Returning a set of versions of resources as part of the history operation on a server</li>
  <li>Storing a collection of resources</li>
  <li>Exchanging a set of resources as part of a message transaction</li>
  <li>Grouping a self-contained set of resources to act as an exchangeable and persistable group with clinical integrity (i.e. a clinical document)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Conceptually, a bundle has an identifier (url) and a date updated, and a list of resources. 
For each resource in the list, the bundle has the resource and also its metadata as listed above.
Each entry in the bundle retains its original identifier. This means that applications reading
the bundle should always look for a resource by its identity (after converting relative URLs
absolute URL) in the bundle first before trying to access it by its URL.
