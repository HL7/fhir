<h2>Policies</h2>
<p>
The Consent resource has a reference to a single <code>policyRule</code>. Many organizations will work in a context where multiple different consent regulations and policies apply. 
In these cases, the single policy rule reference refers to a policy document that resolves and reconciles the various policies and presents a single policy for patient
consent. If it is still necessary to track which of the underlying policies an exception is make in regard to, the <code>policy</code> may be used.
</p>
<h2>General Model</h2>
<p>
The following is the general model of Privacy Consent Directives.
</p>
<p>
There are context setting parameters:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Who - The <b>patient</b>or <b>third-party grantor</b></li>
<li>What - The <b>data</b> - specific resources are listed, empty list means all data covered by the consent.</li>
<li>Where Required - The <b>location boundary</b> and <b>authority boundary</b> of this consent policy domain.</li>
<li>Where Accountability Lies -  The organization or performer</li>
<li>When - The date <b>issued</b> or captured</li>
<li>When - The timeframe for which the Consent <b>applies</b></li>
<li>How - The <b>actions</b> covered. (such as purposes of use that are covered)</li>
<li>Whom - The <b>actor</b> are grantees by the consent. </li>
</ol>
<p>
A Privacy Consent may transition through many states including: that no consent has been sought, consent has been proposed, 
consent has been rejected, and consent approved.
</p>
<p>There are set of patterns.</p>
	  <ol>
	  <li>No consent: All settings need a policy for when no consent has been captured. Often this allows treatment only.;</li>
	  <li>Opt-out: No sharing allowed for the specified domain, location, actions, and purposes;</li>
	  <li>Opt-out with exceptions: No sharing allowed, with some exceptions where it is allowed. Example: Withhold Authorization for Treatment except for Emergency Treatment;</li>
	  <li>Opt-in: Sharing for some purpose of use is authorized Sharing allowed for Treatment, Payment, and normal Operations; and</li>
	  <li>Opt-in with restrictions: Sharing allowed, but the patient may make exceptions.</li>
	  </ol>
      <p>For each of these patterns (positive or negative pattern), there can be exceptions. 
	  These exceptions are explicitly recorded in the <b>except</b> element.
