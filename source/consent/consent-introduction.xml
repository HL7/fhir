<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this Resource is to be used to express a Consent regarding Healthcare. There are four 
anticipated uses for the Consent Resource, all of which are written or verbal agreements by a 
healthcare consumer [grantor] or a personal representative, made to an authorized entity [grantee] 
concerning authorized or restricted actions with any limitations on purpose of use, and 
handling instructions to which the authorized entity must comply: 
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Privacy Consent Directive: Agreement to collect, access, use or disclose (share) information.</li>
 <li>Medical Treatment Consent Directive: Consent to undergo a specific treatment (or record of refusal to consent).</li>
 <li>Research Consent Directive: Consent to participate in research protocol and information sharing required.</li>
 <li>Advance Care Directives: Consent to instructions for potentially needed medical treatment (e.g. DNR).</li>
</ul>
<p>
This resource is scoped to cover all four uses, but at this time, only the privacy use case is modeled.  
The scope of the resource may change when the other possible scopes are investigated, tested, or profiled.
</p>
<p>
A FHIR Consent Directive instance is considered the encoded legally binding Consent Directive if it meets 
requirements of a policy domain requirements for an enforceable contract.   In some domains, electronic 
signatures of one or both of the parties to the content of an encoded representation of a Consent Form 
is deemed to constitute a legally binding Consent Directive.  Some domains accept a notary’s electronic 
signature over the wet or electronic signature of a party to the Consent Directive as the additional 
identity proofing required to make an encoded Consent Directive legally binding.  Other domains may 
only accept a wet signature or might not require the parties’ signatures at all.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the criteria are for making an encoded FHIR Consent Directive legally binding, anything less 
than a legally binding representation of a Consent Directive must be identified as such, i.e., as a 
derivative of the legally binding Consent Directive, which has specific usage in Consent Directive workflow management.

<p><b>Definitions:</b></p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>Consent</td><td>The record of a healthcare consumer’s policy choices or choices made on their behalf by a third party, which permits or denies identified recipient(s) or recipient role(s) to perform one or more actions within a given policy context, for specific purposes and periods of time</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Consent Directive</td><td>The legal record of a healthcare consumer's agreement or agreements made on their behalf with a party responsible for enforcing the consumer’s choices or choices made on their behalf by a third party, which permits or denies identified actors or roles to perform actions affecting the consumer within a given context for specific purposes and periods of time</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Consent Form</td><td>Human readable consent content describing one or more actions impacting the grantor for which the grantee would be authorized or prohibited from performing.  It includes the terms, rules, and conditions pertaining to the authorization or restrictions, such as effective time, applicability or scope, purposes of use, obligations and prohibitions to which the grantee must comply. Once a Consent Form is “executed” by means required by policy, such as verbal agreement, wet signature, or electronic/digital signature, it becomes a legally binding Consent Directive.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Consent Directive Derivative</td><td>Consent Content that conveys the minimal set of information needed to manage Consent Directive workflow, including providing Consent Directive content sufficient to:
<ul><li>Represent a Consent Directive</li>
<li>Register or index a Consent Directive</li>
<li>Query and respond about a Consent Directive</li>
<li>Retrieve a Consent Directive</li>
<li>Notify authorized entities about Consent Directive status changes</li>
<li>Determine entities authorized to collect, access, use or disclose information about the Consent Directive or about the information governed by the Consent Directive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Derived Consent content includes the Security Labels encoding the applicable privacy and security policies.  Consent Security Labels inform recipients about specific access control measures required for compliance.</p>
</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Consent Statement</td><td>A Consent Directive derivative has less than full fidelity to the legally binding Consent Directive from which it was "transcribed".  It  provides recipients with the full content representation they may require for compliance purposes, and typically include a reference to or an attached unstructured representation for recipients needing an exact copy of the legal agreement.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Consent Registration</td><td>The legal record of a healthcare consumer's agreement with a party responsible for enforcing the consumer’s choices, which permits or denies identified actors or roles to perform actions affecting the consumer within a given context for specific purposes and periods of timeA Consent Directive derivative that conveys the minimal set of information needed to register an active and revoked Consent Directive, or to update Consent status as it changes during its lifecycle.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Consent Query/Response Types</td><td>The FHIR Consent Resource specifies multiple Consent Search parameters, which support many types of queries for Consent Resource content. There are several Query/Response patterns that are typically used for obtaining information about consent directive content for the following use cases:
<ul>
<li>Find Active Consent Directive:  A query that includes sufficient consent directive content to determine whether a specific party is authorized to share information governed by a consent directive with another specific party.  The Response is either:
<ul>
<li>“Yes” meaning that both parties are authorized to share the information with one another.</li>
<li>“No” meaning that the authorized querier is not permitted to share with another specific party</li>
<li>“No information found” meaning that there is no active Consent Directive in which the querier is authorized to share the governed information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Find Consent Directive Authorized Entities: A query that includes sufficient consent directive content to return a list of entities with which the querier is authorized to share governed information.  The response to an authorized querier is the list of any authorized entities with which the querier is permitted to share governed information.  The response to an unauthorized querier is that “no information is found”.</li>
<li>Find Consent Directive(s): A query that includes sufficient consent directive content to return a list of Consent Directive metadata for an authorized querier to determine what Consent Directives are available, and to locate and retrieve one or more of those Consent Directives as needed.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Policy context</td><td>Any organizational or jurisdictional policies, which may limit the consumer’s policy choices, and which includes the named range of actions allowed</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Healthcare Consumer</td><td>The individual establishing his/her personal consent (i.e. Consenter). In FHIR, this is referred to as the 'Patient' though this word is not used across all contexts of care</td></tr>

<h3>Privacy Consent Directive (PCD)</h3>

<p>
Privacy policies define how Individually Identifiable Health Information 
(IIHI) is to be collected, accessed, used and disclosed. A Privacy Consent 
Directive as a legal record of a patient's (e.g. a healthcare consumer) 
agreement with a party responsible for enforcing the patient's choices, 
which permits or denies identified actors or roles to perform actions 
affecting the patient within a given context for specific purposes and 
periods of time. All consent directives have a policy context, which is
any set of organizational or jurisdictional policies which may limit the 
consumer’s policy choices, and which include a named range of actions allowed.
In addition, Privacy Consent Directives provide the ability for a healthcare consumer 
to delegate authority to a Substitute Decision Maker who may act on behalf of that individual.
Alternatively, a consumer may author/publish their privacy preferences as a self-declared Privacy Consent Directive.  
</p>
<p>
The Consent resource on FHIR provides support for alternative representations for expressing 
interoperable health information privacy consent directives in a standard form for the 
exchange and enforcement by sending, intermediating, or receiving systems of privacy policies 
that can be enforced by consuming systems (e.g., scanned documents, of computable structured 
entries elements, FHIR structures with optional attached, or referenced unstructured representations.) 
It may be used to represent the Privacy Consent Directive itself, a Consent Statement, which 
electronically represents a Consent Directive, or Consent Metadata, which is the minimum 
necessary consent content derived from a Consent Directive for use in workflow management.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>

<p>
Consent management - particularly privacy consent - is complicated by the fact that consent to share 
is often itself necessary to protect. The need to protect the privacy of the privacy statement itself
competes with the execution of the consent statement. For this reason, it is common to deal with 
'consent statements' that are only partial representations of the full consent statement that the 
patient provided. 
</p>
<p>
For this reason, the consent resource contains two elements that refer back to the source: a master
identifier, and a direct reference to content from which this Consent Statement was derived. That
reference can be one of several things:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A reference to another consent resource from which this limited statement was derived</li>
 <li>A reference to a document format for the original source (e.g. PDF or CDA - see the 
 <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=280">HL7 CDAR2 ConsentDirective Implementation Guide</a>, 
 which incorporated the <a href="http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Basic_Patient_Privacy_Consents">IHE Basic Patient Privacy Consents (BPPC)</a> ), either directly, or in a reference</li>
 <li>The source can be included in the consent as an attachment</li>
</ul>
<p>
The consent statements represent a chain that refers back to the original source consent
directive. Applications may be able to follow the chain back to the source but should
not generally assume that they are authorized to do this.
</p>
<p>
Consent Directives are executed by verbal acknowledge or by being signed - either on paper, or digitally. Consent Signatures will
be found in the <a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a> resource. Implementation Guides will generally 
make rules about what signatures are required, and how they are to be shared and used.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
Change to
"The Consent resource is structured with a base policy (represented as Consent.policy/Consent.policyRule) which is either opt-in or opt-out, followed by a listing of exceptions to that policy (represented as Consent.provision(s)). The exceptions can be additional positive 
or negative exceptions upon the base policy. The set of exceptions include a list of data objects, 
list of authors, list of recipients, list of Organizations, list of purposeOfUse, and Date Range.
</p>
<p>
The enforcement of the Privacy Consent Directive is not included but is expected that 
enforcement can be done using a mix of the various Access Control enforcement methodologies (e.g. OAuth, UMA, XACML).
This enforcement includes the details of the enforcement meaning of the elements of the Privacy Consent Directive, 
such as the rules in place when there is an opt-in consent would be specific about which 
organizational roles have access to what kinds of resources (e.g. RBAC, ABAC). 
The specification of these details is not in scope for the Consent resource.
