  This example provides a basic template for recording
  the consent associated with a SMART on FHIR OAuth dance.

  In SMART on FHIR, the user grants (consents) to a set
  of actions that the server can take when with regard to
  release of information from their own record to the application

  This is not the main intended use of the Consent resource,
  and there's no need for the consent resource as part of
  the SMART on FHIR Authorization process, or when using
  Heart UMA. Using a Consent resource to record and exchange
  the users consent may be useful for recording and storing
  the consent and making it available to the user later,
  or for exchanging the patient's consent between AS and RS,
  or between systems in a multi-system virtual RS a very
  common scenario)

  Note that whichever system builds this Content resource,
  it needs access to information from both the AS and the
  RS.

  Note also, that a situation where a practitioner type user
  authorises the application to access information on a general
  set of patients does not count as 'consent'.
