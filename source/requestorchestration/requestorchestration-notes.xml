  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
    The RequestOrchestration resource is used when there are temporal, co-occurrence or other dependencies between
    one or more steps of an overall workflow.  For example, "do procedure A or procedure B, but not both" or
    "do procedure A after procedure B" or "Act on this ServiceRequest, then use the value of that observation in
    the calculation of the dose of this subsequent MedicationRequest".  RequestOrchestrations that define actions
    (i.e. that are more than just narrative representations) will always reference other Request resources with
    an <code>intent</code> of "option".
  </p>
  <p>
    Each "option" request can only be interpreted in the context of a RequestOrchestration that references it.  This is
    because the RequestOrchestration defines the context in which the option request may/should/must occur, including
    any triggers, timing constraints, choices, sequencing requirements, etc.  Typically such "option" requests
    will be <a href="references.html#contained">contained</a> resources due to this dependency.  However, in some
    cases "option" requests may be stand-alone if they are immutable or tightly tied to a
    <a href="activitydefinition.html">ActivityDefinition</a> such that the option resources can safely be referenced
    without a risk of their content/intent changing
  </p>
  <p>
    Elements in the "option" requests may include extensions for timing or other elements that allow calculation
    based on information found in the RequestOrchestration or other referenced "option" resources, as well as to expose
    elements within the "option" resource for referencing in other "option" resources.  These extensions are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>TODO</li> <!--This should refer to the relativeTime extension but that is still in progress due to cross-version extension issues-->
  </ul>
  <p>
    The RequestOrchestration and all of its referenced "option" Requests are treated as a single integrated Request whose
    status is the status of the RequestOrchestration.  If there is a need to manage statuses of the different parts, separately,
    refer to the guidance <a href="request.html#requestorchestration">here</a>.

  <h3>Documenting Choices</h3>
  <p>
  A RequestOrchestration can be used to document (wholly or in part) options that are to be chosen by the order filler when actually 
  delivering care.  There is no expectation for systems that fulfill a RequestOrchestration to specifically document which choices 
  were made among the options defined.  However, if this is needed, it could be accomplished with a 'filler-order' RequestOrchestration 
  basedOn the 'original-order' RequestOrchestration that narrows the order to reflect the filling clinician's choices.
  </p>

  <p>
  NOTE: The 'intent' of the requests referenced by a RequestOrchestration are never changed from Option to Order or some other value to convey 'selection'.
  </p>

  <a name="completion"> </a>
  <h3>Completion</h3>
  <p>
  A RequestOrchestration is deemed to be complete when the requirements of the request options needed to satisfy at least 
  one path through the overall request have been met or when the author of the RequestOrchestration deems it to be sufficiently complete.
