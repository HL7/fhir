<h1>Terminologies: Using Codes</h1>

<a name="bindings"> </a>
<p>
Many elements in the FHIR resources are assigned a type of <a href="datatypes.htm#code">code</a>, 
<a href="datatypes.htm#Coding">Coding</a> or <a href="datatypes.htm#CodeableConcept">CodeableConcept</a>.
These elements contain codes that are associated with defined meanings defined by frameworks
of varying sophistication and size. In some simple cases, the set of codes is a enumeration, 
a short list defined specifically for the element. In other cases, the list of codes is taken 
from a large and complex terminology or ontology such as SNOMED-CT or OBO. 
</p>
<p>
All these elements of type <a href="datatypes.htm#code">code</a>, <a href="datatypes.htm#Coding">Coding</a> 
or <a href="datatypes.htm#CodeableConcept">CodeableConcept</a> are given a "binding name" that defines the 
set of possible codes that can be used in the element in question. 
</p>
<a name="simple"> </a>
<a name="code"> </a>
<h2>code</h2>
<p>
For simple elements with type <a href="datatypes.htm#code">code</a>, the element 
is either bound to a code list - a list of defined codes, or the binding references 
some external standard that defines the set of valid codes that can be used (typical 
examples of references are <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp13.txt">Mime Types</a>, 
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">Language Codes</a>, <a href="http://unitsofmeasure.org">UCUM</a>, etc).
</p>
<p>
The value of a element of type <i>code</i> SHALL be one of the codes defined by the code list or reference.
</p>
<p>
No other codes can be used in an instance. If the binding is a code list, the list of codes may
be extended in subsequent releases of the specification. Profiles may state rules on which codes
may be used in particular contexts, but cannot define new or additional codes for these elements.
</p>
<a name="complex"> </a>
<a name="codeable"> </a>
<h2>CodeableConcept / Coding</h2>
<p>
For elements with type <a href="datatypes.htm#CodeableConcept">CodeableConcept</a> or 
<a href="datatypes.htm#Coding">Coding</a>, the binding refers to a <a href="valueset.htm">
Value Set</a> that defines a list of concepts along with the code/system pairs that refer
to them. The binding to the value set may be labelled as just an example.
</p>
<p>
If the binding is not an example binding, then an code/system pair in the instance
SHOULD refer to one of the concepts that is a member of the value set.
</p>
<p>
Bindings to value sets provided as part of the specification are always specific
to the version of the value set published with the specification. The value set 
may be sealed by defining a simple list of enumerated codes, or it may include 
codes by their properties, in which case the list of valid concepts may grow
or change over time.
</p>
<p>
Profiles can redefine the binding and are able to be much more precise about
exactly which codes can be used for these elements (see <a href="profile.htm#binding">Binding 
Control</a> for more detail).

<h2>Reference Tables</h2>

<p>
The following reference tables are provided to help implementers:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="terminologies-systems.htm">Systems List</a>: Some known system identifiers suitable for use in 
     the <i>system</i> element of CodeableConcept, Coding, and Identifier elements</li>
 <li><a href="terminologies-bindings.htm">Bindings List</a>: a full list of the binding names defined for all FHIR resources</li>
 <li><a href="terminologies-codes.htm">Code Lists</a>: Code lists defined as part of this specification</li>
 <li><a href="terminologies-valuesets.htm">Value Sets</a>: Value sets defined as part of this specification</li>
 <li><a href="terminologies-v2.htm">v2 Tables list</a>: A list of v2 tables that can be used in resources</li>
 <li><a href="terminologies-v3.htm">v3 code systems list</a>: A list of v3 code systems that can be used in resources</li>
