<h2>Why not custom resources?</h2>
<p>
Technically, nothing prevents implementers from going off and defining their own resources containing
whatever data elements they wish.  However, doing so causes several issues:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Custom resources don't have a discoverability mechanism in the same way custom codes and extensions
  do using the <a href="profiling.html">Profile</a> resources.  As a 
  result, any implementer that receives a custom resource would have no way of looking up what the meaning 
  of the resource or its elements were.  While they could get some sense of meaning from XML or JSON tag names, this often 
  isn't sufficient for safe healthcare interoperability.</li>
  <li>Custom resource names would not be present in the FHIR schemas as allowed elements within the FHIR
  Bundle schema and would also not be present in the enumeration of resources in the Reference type.  
  This would cause issues for any receiving system making use of the schemas directly or via code-generation.</li>
  <li>There is no means of ensuring that two implementers might independently come up with the same name for
  a resource but define it differently in terms of meaning as well as allowed elements.  This would also cause
  interoperability issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>
All of these concerns are mitigated when there's an assumption that the custom resource will only be used
within a narrow constrained environment where all participants will be aware of the semantics, will be using
the same custom schemas and there's no chance of collisions.  However, HL7's experience is that closed
implementation environments rarely remain that way over the long term.  Eventually data will need to be
shared with others outside the closed environment and all of the above issues will again come into play.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, use of 'custom' resources is <b>NOT</b> considered to be conformant with FHIR.  While the use of
extensions may make the Other resource slightly more complex and less visually appealing, it is the only safe
and approved mechanism for sharing resource concepts not representable using standard HL7-defined resources.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: This position is subject to change based on implementation experience.  Alternative mechanisms for
handling custom resource requirements in a safe manner may be explored.  Ideas around alternative technical 
strategies for managing this issue are welcome.
</p>

<h2>Best practices for using 'Other'</h2>
<p>
There are several good practices to follow when making use of the Other resource:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Before using Other, post a description of the desired resource type on HL7's FHIR list-server or on
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hl7_fhir">Stack Overflow</a> to see whether the
  use-case can be met by an existing resource.  (Sometimes the intended scope of an existing resource won't 
  be clear, even if the intent is to cover your space.)  Using an existing resource is usually preferable
  to using Other as it significantly increases the likelihood of interoperability.</li>
  
  <li>If an existing resource would normally be a good fit for your use-case but can't be used due to
  overly prescriptive constraints your implementation is unable to meet, again raise the problem on
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hl7_fhir">Stack Overflow</a> so the problem with the
  specification can be addressed</li>
  
  <li>If it is necessary to make use of the Other resource, try to use one of the HL7-defined codes for
  resource type or submit your requirement for a new type for inclusion in the HL7 vocabulary, as this will
  increase the likelihood of interoperability.  Alternate code systems are conformant, but are less likely to
  be recognized or re-used across the healthcare implementation space.</li>
  
  <li>Architect your interface in a way that will make it less painful to swap your use of Other with an
  'official' resource in the event that a future release of FHIR formally defines a resource that encompasses
  your use-case.</li>
  
  <li>Use a <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a> to define the extensions relevant to each type of other resource used.
  Profile can also be used to define additional search criteria appropriate for the resource.</li>
  <!-- Todo: Search criteria have been removed from Profile, but they need to come back -->
</ol>

<p>
Other should <b>always</b> be defined by the use of a 
</p>

<h2>Referencing Other resources</h2>
<p>
None of the standard resources will have direct references to Other, aside from those that allow linking to
"Any" resource.  As a result, most references to "Other" will need to be performed using extensions.
