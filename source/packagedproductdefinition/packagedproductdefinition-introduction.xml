		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p><b><i>For an overview of this resource and others in the Medication Definition domain, also see the <a href="medication-definition-module.html">module page</a></i></b></p>
		<p>
			A medically related item or items of any type, in a container or package, representing the unit that has been prepared for sale, supply or similar use.
			These can include packaged medications, devices and other items such as food, biologicals, raw materials, medical fluids, gases etc.
			This resource represents the whole package of items, and all the packaging within, rather than the individual items themselves. 
			In some cases a "product" exists at a logically higher level, which has a variety of available packages associated with it, typically of different sizes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note about recursive relationships in this resource:
			This resource has two recursive relationships. 
			One is meant to be "internal" to the package - for package layers and contents, and the other for aggregated packages (e.g. for wholesaling) that are 
			made up of other packages.<br/>  
			PackagedProductDefinition.package.package<br/>
			This recursive relationship is for the inner parts and containers within a package, which is normally indivisible and is marketed or prescribed as a whole entity. See also PackagedProductDefinition.package.containedItem.item(PackagedProductDefinition)
			<br/>
			PackagedProductDefinition.package.containedItem.item(PackagedProductDefinition)<br/> 
			This recursive route, which is for cases where the whole (indivisible) package is then aggregated into another, divisible, package, for example a warehousing or transport pack. This represents a package of packages. It is not used for the internal parts of a single package. For which see PackagedProductDefinition.package.package.
