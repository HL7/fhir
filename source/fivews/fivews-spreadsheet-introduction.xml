<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
All resources include some attribution information. Classically, this information includes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Who</li>
 <li>What</li>
 <li>When</li>
 <li>Where</li>
 <li>Why</li>
</ul>
<p>

This is classically known as the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws">Five Ws</a>' - hence the name of this pattern. The pattern also includes 
additional information that is common across many resources.
</p>
<p>
The Five Ws logical model is <b>NOT</b> a resource.  It is not part of the FHIR schema and cannot appear directly in FHIR instances.  
Instead, it defines a pattern adhered to by other resources.  This pattern serves two purposes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It offers guidance to work groups designing resources and helps ensure consistency of content created by different work groups</li>
  <li>It provides a standard "view" that might be useful for implementers in processing and manipulating all resources that adhere to the same pattern.  (Tooling that supports
  this may become available in a future release.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that the guidance here is around the types of information that might be captured, not around element names.  
For example "why" would more typically be labeled as something like "reason" and "where" would be more typically labeled "location"
