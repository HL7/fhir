<h2>Search</h2>

<p>
One aspect that is fundamental to the way FHIR works is to search a set of resources.
Search operations search through an existing set of resources by a set
of search criteria supplied as parameters to the search. This page documents
the FHIR search framework, starting with the simple cases, and working through
to the full complexity. Implementations need only implement the amount of
complexity that they require.
</p>
<p>
In the simplest case, a search is executed by performing a GET operation
in the RESTful framework:
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/[resourcetype]?name=value&amp;...
</pre>
<p>
For this RESTful search (see <a href="http.html#search">definition in RESTful API</a>), the parameters are a series
of name=[value] pairs encoded in the URL or as an
application/x-www-form-urlencoded submission for a POST.
The server returns the results in the HTTP response as a bundle (in XML, an atom feed)
which includes the resources that are the results of the search. The server can also
include additional resources in the result set, such as <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome</a>
resources. Clients should ignore resources that don't have the expected type.
A HTTP status code of 403 signifies that the server refused to perform the search,
while some other 4xx or 5xx code signifies that some error occurred.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http.html#search">Search operations</a> are executed in one of 3 defined contexts that control which set of resources are being searched:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A specified resource type: GET [base]/[resourcetype]?parameter(s)</li>
 <li>A specified <a href="extras.html#compartments">compartment</a>, perhaps with a specified resource type in that compartment: GET [base]/patient/[id]/[resourcetype]?parameter(s)</li>
 <li>All resources: GET [base]/_search?parameter(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Search operations can also be initiated by other more complex and flexible
methods described below, which change both the way the search is initiated, and
the results that are returned.
</p>
<a name="standard"> </a>
<h3>Standard Parameters</h3>

<a name="all"> </a>
<h4>Parameters for all resources</h4>
<p>
These parameters are <a href="resource.html#search">defined that apply to all resources</a>: [%allparams%].
</p>
<p>
The search parameter _id refers to the logical id of the resource, and can be used when the search context specifies a resource type:
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/Patient?_id=23
</pre>
<p>
This search finds the patient resource with the given id (there can only be one
resource for a given id). Functionally, this is equivalent to a <a href="http.html#read">simple
read operation</a>:
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/Patient/23
</pre>
<p>
except that it returns a bundle with the requested resource, rather than the
resource itself. Additional parameters can be added which may provide
additional functionality on top of this base read equivalence.
</p>
<p>
The search parameter _language refers to the base language of the resource:
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/Composition?_language=fr
</pre>
<p>
This search finds any composition with a designated language of French.
Note that this is the claimed language of the resource, not the actual
language of the content.
</p>
<p>
The search parameter _lastUpdated can be used to select resources based
on the last time they were changed:
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/Observation?_lastUpdated=>2010-10-01
</pre>
<p>
This search finds any observations changed since 1-Oct 2010. When
this search parameter is used, applications should consider
synchronization approaches (<a href="http.html#history">RESTful history</a>
or the <a href="subscription.html">Subscription resource</a>.
</p>
<a name="tag" />
<a name="tags" />
<a name="profile" />

<p>
The search parameters _tag, _profile and _security parameters search
on the equivalent elements in the <a href="resource.html#meta">meta element</a>.
For example
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/Condition?_tag=http://acme.org/codes|needs-review
</pre>
<p>
searches for all Condition resources with the tag:
</p>
<pre class="json">
{
  "system" : "http://acme.org/codes",
  "code" : "needs-review"
}
</pre>
<p>
In the same manner:
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/DiagnosticReport?_profile=http://hl7.org/fhir/Profile/lipid
 GET [base]/DiagnosticReport?_profile=Profile/lipid
</pre>
<p>
restricts the search to only DiagnosticReport resources that are tagged that they conform to a particular profile.
The second reference is relative, and refers a local profile on the same server.
</p>
<p>
_tag, _profile and _security parameters are all token types (see <a href="#token">below</a>).
</p>


<h4>Parameters for each resource</h4>
<p>
In addition to the _id parameter which exists for all resources, each
FHIR resource type defines its own set of search parameters with
their names, types, and meanings. These search parameters are on the
same page as the resource definitions, and are also published as part
of the standard conformance statement (<a href="conformance-base.xml.html">XML</a> or <a href="conformance-base.json.html">JSON</a>).
</p>
<p>
Mostly, the defined search parameters correspond to a
single element in the resource, but this is not required, and some
search parameters refer to the same type of element in multiple
places, or refer to derived values.
</p>
<p>
Some of the search parameters defined by the resources are associated
with more than one path in the resource. This means that the search
parameter matches if any of the paths contain matching content, and
which ever path matches, the whole resource is returned in the
search results. The client may have to examine the resource to determine
which path contains the match.
</p>
<p>
Servers are not required to implement any of these search parameters
(except for the _id parameter described above), and may define their own
additional parameters if they wish.
</p>

<a name="ptypes" />
<h4>Search Parameter Types</h4>
<p>Each search parameter is defined with a type that defines how the search parameter
behaves. These are the defined parameter types:
</p>
<%codelist SearchParamType%>
<p>
The search parameters can also have "modifiers" appended to them that control
their behavior. The kind of modifiers that can be used depend on the type
of parameter.
</p>

<a name="modifiers" />
<h4>Modifiers</h4>
<p>Parameters are defined per resource, and their names may additionally specify a modifier as a suffix,
separated from the parameter name by a colon. Modifiers are:</p>
<ul>
 <li>For all parameters (except combination): ":missing". E.g. gender:missing=true (or false).
  Searching for "gender:missing=true" will return all the resources that don't have any value for the gender parameter (which usually
  equates to not having the relevant element in the resource). Searching for "gender:missing=false"
  will return all the resources that have a value for the "gender" parameter. </li>
 <li>For string: ":exact" (the match needs to be exact, no partial matches, case sensitive and accent-sensitive), instead of the default behavior, which is that the search does partial matches. It is at the discretion of the server whether to do a left-partial search</li>
 <li>For token: ":text" (the match does a partial searches on the text portion of a CodeableConcept or the display portion of a Coding), instead of the default search which uses codes. Other define modifiers are ";in", ":below", ":above", ":in" and ":not-in" which are described below</li>
 <li>For reference: ":[type]" where [type] is the name of a type of resource</li>
</ul>

<a name="number" />
<h4>number</h4>
<p>
The prefixes &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, and &lt; may be used on the parameter value,
and have the usual meaning (note that "=" must be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">URL-encoded</a> in the
value in a URL). Examples:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>[parameter]=100</td><td>Values that equal 100, to 2 significant figures precision, so range [99.5 ... 100.5)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>[parameter]=100.00</td><td>Values that equal 100, to 4 significant figures precision, so range [99.995 ... 100.005). Whole numbers also equal 100.00, but not 100.01</td></tr>
 <tr><td>[parameter]=&lt;100</td><td>Values that are less than 100</td></tr>
 <tr><td>[parameter]=&lt;=100</td><td>Values that are less or equal to 100</td></tr>
 <tr><td>[parameter]=&gt;100</td><td>Values that are greater than 100</td></tr>
 <tr><td>[parameter]=&gt;=100</td><td>Values that are greater or equal to 100</td></tr>
 <tr><td>[parameter]=!=100</td><td>Values that are not equal to 100. Precision works as for equals (this operation is the logical converse of equals)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
For comparisons involving &lt; or &gt;, uncertainty does not factor, and the precision of the numbers is considered arbitrarily high.
Note that the way these search parameters operate here is not the same as whether two numbers are equal to each other in a mathematical sense.
</p>

<a name="date" />
<h4>date</h4>
<p>
A date parameter searches on a date/time or period. The prefixes &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, and &lt; may be used on the parameter value,
and have the usual meaning. However, as is usual for date/time related functionality, while the
concepts are relatively straight-forward, there are a number of subtleties involved in ensuring consistent behavior.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The date parameter format is yyyy-mm-ddThh:nn:ss(TZ) (the standard XML format).
   <ul>
     <li>Technically, this is any of the <a href="datatypes.html#date">date</a>, <a href="datatypes.html#dateTime">dateTime</a>, and <a href="datatypes.html#instant">instant</a> data types</li>
     <li>e.g. Any degree of precision can be provided, but it SHALL be populated from the left (e.g. can't specify a month without a year), except that the minutes SHALL be present if an hour is present, and you SHOULD provide a time zone if the time part is present</li>
     <li>Some user agents may escape the ":" characters in the URL, and servers SHALL handle this correctly</li>
   </ul>
 </li>
 <li>[parameter]=[date] searches for resources where the date is within
   the period implied by the given value in [date]. "[parameter]=&gt;[date]" searches for all resources where the specified date is after [date].
   "[parameter]=&lt;=[date]" searches for all resources where the specified date is in or before [date], etc. </li>
 <li>The element the search refers to may have a datatype of <a href="datatypes.html#date">date</a>,
 <a href="datatypes.html#dateTime">dateTime</a>, <a href="datatypes.html#instant">instant</a>,
 <a href="datatypes.html#Period">Period</a>, or <a href="datatypes.html#Schedule">Schedule</a>.
 All of these time related types actually specify an interval of time, as does the search parameter itself.
  <ul>
    <li>For Period and Schedule, the fact that they refer to an interval of time is explicit (though the upper or lower bound may not actually be specified in resources)</li>
 	<li>For a date or a dateTime (and the search parameter), the interval is implicit. For example, the date 2013-01-10 specifies all the time from 00:00 on 10-Jan 2013 to immediately before 00:00 on 11-Jan 2013.</li>
    <li>An instant (which is the same as a fully specified dateTime with milliseconds) is considered a fixed point in time with an interval smaller than the precision of the system, i.e. an interval with an effective width of 0.</li>
   </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Date parameter searches are always matched based on the behavior of intervals, as follows:
   <ul>
     <li>For [parameter]=[date], the requirement is that the search interval fully contains the time of the target. i.e. [parameter]=2013-01-14 includes 2013-01-14T00:00 (obviously) and also 2013-01-14T10:00 but not 2013-01-15T00:00</li>
     <li>For [parameter]=!=[date], the requirement is that the search interval does not fully contain the time of the target. i.e. [parameter]=!=2013-01-14 includes 2013-01-15T00:00 but not 2013-01-14T00:00 or 2013-01-14T10:00</li>
	 <li>For "[parameter]=&lt;[date]", the requirement is that the interval of the time before [date] intersects (i.e. overlaps) with the interval of time in the relevant resource element.
	    For instance, the resource time 2013-01-14 is included in the set of values that come before 2013-01-14T10:00, because it includes the part of 14-Jan 2013 before 10am </li>
	 <li>For "[parameter]=&gt;[date]", the requirement is that the interval of the time after [date] intersects (i.e. overlaps) with the interval of time in the relevant resource element.
	    For instance, the resource time 2013-01-14 is included in the set of values that come after 2013-01-14T10:00, because it includes the part of 14-Jan 2013 after 10am</li>
   </ul>
   Implicitly, a missing lower boundary is 'less than' any actual date.  A missing upper boundary is 'greater than' any actual date.
   For instance, the period from 21-Jan 2013 onwards is included in matches for date=&gt;=2013-03-14 because it may include times after 14-Mar 2013.
 </li>
 <li>Similarly, when the date parameter is not fully specified, matches against it are based on the behavior of intervals, where:
	<ul>
		<li>Dates with just the year specified are equivalent to an interval that starts at the first instant of January 1st to the last instant of December 31st, e.g. 2000 is equivalent to an interval of [2000-01-01T00:00, 2000-12-31T23:59]</li>
		<li>Dates with the year and month are equivalent to an interval that starts at the first instant of the first day of the month and ends on the last instant of the last day of the month, e.g. 2000-04 is equivalent to an interval of [2000-04-01T00:00, 2000-04-30T23:59]</li>
	</ul>
 </li>
 <li>Where possible, the system should correct for timezones when performing queries. Dates do not have time zones, and time zones
   should not be considered. Where both search parameters and resource element date times do not have time zones, the servers local
   time zone should be assumed.
 </li>
 <li>
   Note that for a Schedule data type, the specified scheduling details are ignored and only the outer limits matter. For instance, a schedule that specifies every second day between
   31-Jan 2013 and 24-Mar 2013 includes 1-Feb 2013, even though that is on an odd day that is not specified by the period. This is
   to keep the server load processing queries reasonable.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
As an example, the following search searches for all the procedures in a patient compartment that occurred over a 2 year period:
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/Patient/23/Procedure?date=&gt;2010-01-01&amp;date=&lt;2011-12-31
</pre>


<a name="string" />
<h4>string</h4>
<p>
The string parameter refer to simple string searches against sequences of characters.
Matches are case- and accent- insensitive. By default, a match exists if a portion of
the parameter value contains the specified string. It is at the discretion of the
server whether to do a left-partial search. The modifier :exact can be used to indicate
that the match needs to be exact (the whole string, including casing and accents). For example:
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/Patient?name=eve
 GET [base]/Patient?name:exact=Eve
</pre>
<p>
The first is a request to find any patients with "eve" in any part of the name. This would
include patients with the name "Eve", "Severine", etc. The second search would only return
patients with the name "Eve".
</p>
<p>
An additional modifier :text
can be used to specify a search with advanced text handling (see <a href="#text">below</a>)
though only a few servers are expected to offer this facility.
</p>
<p>
It is at the discretion of the server whether to pre-process names, addresses,
and contact details to remove separator characters prior to matching in order
to ensure more consistent behavior. For example, a server might remove all
spaces and "-" characters from phone numbers. What is most appropriate varies
depending on culture and context.
</p>

<a name="token" />
<h4>token</h4>
<p>
A token type is a parameter that searches on a code or identifier value
where the value may have a URI that scopes its meaning (from a <a href="datatypes.html#Coding">Coding</a>,
a <a href="datatypes.html#CodeableConcept">CodeableConcept</a> or an <a href="datatypes.html#Identifier">Identifier</a> type, and also
from a <a href="datatypes.html#code">code</a> where the URI is implicit).
</p>
<p>
If the parameter has no modifier, the search is performed against
the URI/value from a Coding or an Identifier. The syntax for the
value is one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>[parameter]=[code]</b>: the value of [code] matches a Coding.code or Identifier.value irrespective of the value of the system property</li>
 <li><b>[parameter]=[system]|[code]</b>: the value of [code] matches a Coding.code or Identifier.value, and the value of [system] matches the system property of the Identifier or Coding</li>
 <li><b>[parameter]=|[code]</b>: the value of [code] matches a Coding.code or Identifier.value, and the Coding/Identifier has no system property</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that the namespace URI and code both must be <a href="#escaping">escaped</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Modifiers:</b></p>
<table class="lines">
 <tr> <td><b>Modifier</b></td> <td><b>Use</b></td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>:text</td> <td>the search parameter is processed as a string that searches text associated with the code/value - either <i>CodeableConcept.text</i>, <i>Coding.display</i>, or <i>Identifier.label</i></td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>:not</td> <td>reverse the code matching described in the paragraph above</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>:above</td> <td>the search parameter is a concept with the form [system]|[code], and the search parameter tests whether the coding in a resource subsumes the specified search code (e.g. the search concept has an is-a relationship with the coding in the resource)</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>:below</td> <td>the search parameter is a concept with the form [system]|[code], and the search parameter tests whether the coding in a resource is subsumed by the specified search code (e.g. the coding in the resource has an is-a relationship with the search concept)</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>:in</td> <td>the search parameter is a URI (relative or absolute) that identifies a value set, and the search parameter tests whether the coding is in the specified <a href="valueset.html">value set</a>. The reference may be literal (to an address where the value set can be found) or logical (a referecnce to ValueSet.identifier)</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>:not-in</td> <td>the search parameter is a URI (relative or absolute) that identifies a value set, and the search parameter tests whether the coding is not in the specified value set</td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
Most servers will only process value sets that are already known/registered/supported internally, but servers can elect to accept any valid reference to a value set.
Servers may elect to consider concept mappings when testing for subsumption relationships.
</p>

<p>
Here are some example searches:
</p>
<table>
 <tr><td width="50%"><b>Search</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre> GET [base]/Patient?identifier=http://acme.org/patient|2345</pre></td><td>Search for all the patients with an identifier with key = "2345" in the system "http://acme.org/patient"</td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre> GET [base]/Patient?gender=male</pre></td><td>Search for any patient with a gender that has a code "male", irrespective of the system. Note that this usually isn't very useful - systems generally define symbols where overlap is coincidental and not informative</td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre> GET [base]/Patient?gender=http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0001|M</pre></td><td>Search for any patient with a gender which is coded as "M" in the HL7 Administrative Gender table</td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre> GET [base]/Patient?gender:text=male</pre></td><td>Search for any patient with a gender that has a text "male" associated with it (note: this will include "female")</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="quantity" />
<h4>quantity</h4>
<p>
A quantity parameter searches on the <a href="datatypes.html#Quantity">Quantity</a> data type.
The syntax for the value follows the form:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>[parameter]=[comparator][number]|[system]|[code]</b> matches a quantity with the given unit</li>
</ul>
<p>
The comparator is optional; if it is not present, the default comparator is "=". A special value "~" can be used for approximation.  Example searches:
</p>

<table>
 <tr><td width="50%"><b>Search</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre> GET [base]/Observation?value=5.4|http://unitsofmeasure.org|mg</pre></td><td>Search for all the observations with a value of 5.4 mg where mg is understood as a UCUM unit (system/code)</td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre> GET [base]/Observation?value=5.4||mg</pre></td><td>Search for all the observations with a value of 5.4 mg where the units - either the code  or the stated human units (units) are "mg"</td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre> GET [base]/Observation?value=&lt;5.4|http://unitsofmeasure.org|mg</pre></td><td>Search for all the observations where the value of is less than 5.4 mg where mg is understood as a UCUM unit</td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre> GET [base]/Observation?value=~5.4|http://unitsofmeasure.org|mg</pre></td><td>Search for all the observations where the value of is about 5.4 mg where mg is understood as a UCUM unit.
   The recommended value for the approximation is 10% of the stated value, but systems may choose other values where appropriate</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The search processor may choose to perform a search based on <a href="datatypes.html#quantity">canonical units</a> (e.g. any value where the units can be converted to a value in mg in the case above)
</p>


<a name="chaining" />
<a name="reference" />
<h4>reference</h4>
<p>
A reference parameter refers to <a href="references.html">references between resources</a>, e.g. find all
Conditions where the subject reference is a particular patient, where the patient is selected by name or identifier.
The interpretation of a <i>reference</i> parameter is either:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>[parameter]=[id]</b> the logical [id] of a resource using a local reference (i.e. a relative reference)</li>
 <li><b>[parameter]=[url]</b> where the [url] is an absolute URL - a reference to a resource by its absolute location</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that if a relative reference resolves to the same value as a specified absolute URL, or vice versa, this is a match too.
</p>
<p>
Some references are allowed to point to more than one type of resource. e.g. subject : Reference(Patient|Group|Device|..).
In these cases, multiple different resources may have the same logical identifier. In this case, the client can specify
a type modifier after the name of the parameter to be explicit about the intended type:
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/Condition?subject:Patient=23
</pre>
<p>
This searches for any conditions where the subject refers to the patient resource with the
logical identifier "23". The server SHOULD reject a search where the logical id refers to
more than one matching resource across different types. Note that the :[type] modifier
can't be used with a reference to a resource found on another server, since the server
would not usually know what type that resource has (but since these are absolute
references, there can be no ambiguity about the type).
</p>

<h4>Chained parameters</h4>
<p>
In order to save a client from doing a series of search operations,
reference parameters may be "chained" by appending them with
a period (.) followed by the name of a search parameter defined for the target
resource. This can be done recursively, following a logical path
through a graph of related resources, separated by ".".
For instance, given that
the resource <a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReport</a>
has a search parameter named <i>subject</i>, which is usually a
reference to a <a href="patient.html">Patient</a> resource, and
the Patient resource includes a parameter <i>name</i> which
searches on patient name, then the search
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/DiagnosticReport?subject.name=peter
</pre>
<p>
is a request to return all the lab reports that have a subject whose name includes "peter". Because
the Diagnostic Report subject can be one of a set of different resources, it's possible to limit
the search to a particular type:
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/DiagnosticReport?subject:Patient.name=peter
</pre>
<p>
Which is a request to return all the lab reports that have a subject which is a patient, whose name includes "peter".
</p>

<p>
Advanced Search Note:
Where a chained parameter searches a resource reference that may have more than one
different type of resource as its target, the parameter chain may end up referring
to search parameters with the same name on more than one kind of resource at once.
The parameter names defined in FHIR have consistent types wherever they are used.
Implementers defining their own names need to be sure that they do not create
unprocessable combinations. Servers SHOULD reject queries chained queries
that lead to disjoint types along the path (e.g. the client has to specify
the type explicitly using the syntax in the second example above).
</p>

<a name="composite" />
<a name="combining" />
<h4>Composite Search Parameters</h4>
<p>
The result of the search operation is the intersection of the resources that match the criteria specified by each
individual search parameter. If a parameter repeats, such as /patient?language=FR&amp;language=NL, then
this matches a patient who speaks both languages. This is known as an AND search parameter, since the
server is expected to respond only with results which match both values.
</p>
<p>
If, instead, the search is to find patients that speak either
language, then this is a single parameter with multiple values, separated by a ','.
For example: "/patient?language=FR,NL". This is known as an OR search parameter,
since the server is expected to respond with results which match either value.
</p>
<p>
AND parameters and OR parameters may also be combined, for example:
"/patient?language=FR,NL&amp;language=EN" would refer to any patient who speaks
English as well as either French or Dutch.
</p>
<p>
This allows for simple combinations of and/or values, but doesn't allow a search based on
a pair of values, such as all observations with a sodium value >150 mmol/L (particularly
as the end criteria of a chained search), or searching on Group.characteristic: you need
find a combination of key/value, not an intersection of separate matches on key and value.
Another example is spatial coordinates when doing geographical searches.
</p>
<p>
To allow these searches, a resource may also specify <i>composite</i> parameters
that take sequences of single values that match other defined parameters as an
argument. The matching parameter of each component in such a sequence
is documented in the definition of the parameter. These sequences are formed by
joining the single values with a "$".  Note that this sequence is a single
value and itself can be composed into a set of values, so that, for example,
multiple matching state-on-date parameters can be specified as
state-on-date=new$2013-05-04,active$2013-05-05.
</p>
<p>
Modifiers are not used on composite parameters.
<!--
Future note: use \p and \m in search values? if we add a double = to parameter value for text, that would get rid
of :exact.
Won't try to get rid of type modifier - that's the real use for modifiers because it has to be in a chaining line.
Other modifier is :text on token - use "~"? or ""?
-->

<h4>Escaping Search Parameters</h4>
<p>
In the rules above, special rules are defined for the characters "$", ",", and "|".
As a consequence, if these characters appear in an actual parameter value,
they must be differentiated from their use as separator characters. When
any of these characters appear in an actual parameter value, they must be
prepended by the character "\" (which also must be used to prepend itself).
So "param=xxx$xxx" means a composite parameter, while "param=xx\$xx" means that
the parameter has the literal value 'xx$xx'. The parameter value "xx\xx" is illegal,
and the parameter value "param=xx\\xx" means a literal value of 'xx\xx'.
</p>


<a name="text" />
<h4>Text Search Parameters</h4>
<p>
There are two special text search parameters, _text and _content, which search
on the narrative of the resource, and the entire content of the resource respectively.
These parameters SHOULD support a sophisticated search functionality of the type
offered by typical text indexing services is appropriate.
The value of the parameter is a text based search, which may involve searching
multiple words with thesaurus and proximity considerations, and logical operations
such as AND, OR etc. For example:
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/Condition?_text=(bone OR liver) and metastases
</pre>
<p>
This searches for all Condition resources with the word "metastases" and either
"bone" or "liver" in the narrative. The server MAY choose to search
for related words as well.

<p><b>DSTU Note</b>: The issues around standardizing text search are not fully resolved.
During the trial use period for this specification, we recommend that systems use
the rules specified by <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/cs01/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-cs01-part1-protocol.html#_The_$search_System">

<a name="_filter"> </a>
<h4>Advanced filtering</h4>

<p>
The search mechanism described above is flexible, and easy to implement
for simple cases, but it is limited in its ability to express combination
queries. To complement this mechanism, a specific search expression
parameter can also be used, named "_filter".
</p>
<p>
For example, this is a moderately simple search: find all the
observations for patient with a name including "peter" that have a LOINC code 1234-5:
</p>
<pre>
GET [base]/Observation?name=http://loinc.org|1234-5&amp;subject.name=peter
</pre>
<p>
Using the _filter parameter, the search would be expressed like this:
</p>
<pre>
GET [base]/Observation?_filter=name eq http://loinc.org|1234-5 and subject.name co "peter"
</pre>
<p>
The _filter parameter is described in detail on the <a href="search_filter.html">"_Filter Parameter" page</a>.
</p>

<a name="return"> </a>
<h3>Managing Returned Resources</h3>

<a name="score"> </a>
<h4>Relevance</h4>
<p>
Where a search specifies a non-deterministic sort, the search algorithm
may generate some kind of ranking score to indicate which resources meet
the specified criteria better than others. The server can return this
score in <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.entry.score">entry.score</a>:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;entry&gt;
    &lt;score value=&quot;.45&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;Patient&gt;
      ... patient data ...
    &lt;/Patient&gt;
  &lt;/entry&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The score is a decimal number with a value between (and including) 0 and 1, where 1 is best match, and 0 is least match.
</p>

<a name="sort" />
<h4>Sorting</h4>
<p>
The client can indicate which order to return the results in
using the parameter "_sort", which can have a value of one of the search parameters.
The _sort parameter can repeat to indicate sort order, with the repeats indicating
a lower sort priority sequentially.
</p>
<p>
The _sort parameter takes one of two qualifiers, ":asc" and ":desc", which specify
ascending and descending sort order respectively. The default value is ":asc".
</p>
<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>When sorting, the actual sort value used is not returned explicitly
by the server for each resource, just the resource contents</li>
 <li>To sort by relevance, use "_sort:asc=_score"</li>
 <li>The server returns the sort it performs as part of the returned search parameters (see <a href="#conformance">below</a>)</li>
 <li>A search parameter can refer to an element that repeat, and therefore
there can be multiple values for a given search parameter for a single
resource. In this case, the sort is based on the item in the set of
multiple parameters that comes earliest in the specified sort order
when ordering the returned resources. </li>
</ul>


<h4>Page Count</h4>

<p>
In order to keep the load on clients, servers and the network
minimized, the server may choose to return the results in
a series of pages. The search result set contains the URLs
that the client uses to request additional pages from the
search set. For a simple RESTful search, the page links are
<a href="http.html#paging">contained in the returned bundle as links</a>.
</p>
<p>
Typically a server will provide its own parameters in the links
that it uses to manage the state of the search as pages are
retrieved. These parameters do not need to be understood
or processed by the client.
</p>

<p>
The parameter _count is defined as a hint to the server
regarding how many resources should be returned in a
single page. Servers SHALL not return more resources than
requested (even if they don't support paging) but are
allowed to return less than the client asked for. Note
that it is at the discretion of the search engine how to
handle ongoing updates to the resources while the search
is proceeding.
</p>

<a name="include" />
<h4>Including other resources in result (_include)</h4>
<p>
Clients may request that the engine return additional resources related to
the search results, in order to reduce the overall network delay.
A typical case where this is useful is where the client is searching on
some type of clinical resource, but for every such resource returned,
the client will also need the subject (patient) resource that the
clinical resource refers to. The client requests that the subject
resources be included in the results set by providing one or more
_include parameters.
</p>
<p>
Each _include parameter specifies a path to a url (usually a resource reference):
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/MedicationDispense?_include=MedicationDispense.authorizingPrescription
    &amp;_include=MedicationPrescription.prescriber&amp;criteria...
</pre>
<p>
For each returned resource, the server collects the elements described by the path,
and any resources they point to that the server also holds are added to the results,
with the <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.entry.status">entry.status</a>
set to "include" (in some searches, it is not obvious which resources are
matches, and which are includes).
This example search returns all the <a href="medicationprescription.html">Medication
Prescription</a> resources and their <a href="practitioner.html">prescribing Practitioner</a> Resources
for the matching <a href="medicationdispense.html">Medication Dispense</a> resources.
</p>
<h4>Include Paths</h4>
<p>
An include path begins at the root of a FHIR resource and must include exactly one property of
type <a href="references.html#Identification">Reference</a> or <a href="datatypes.html#uri">uri</a>,
which must appear in the terminal position. That means that an
include path cannot "cross the boundary" from one resource to another.  So for example,
`CarePlan.activity.simple.performer` is a valid include path, because it begins at the
root of the CarePlan resource and ends with a reference to another resource
(Practitioner|Organization|RelatedPerson|Patient). On the other hand,
`CarePlan.patient.managingOrganization` is an invalid include path, because it
includes two References (patient and managingOrganization), and `CarePlan.goal`
is an invalid include path because it does not end with a Reference or a URI.
</p>
<p>
When looking for the references indicated by an include path, all occurrences of
the component last encountered
on the that path need to be considered, including occurrences of that same
component reachable via deeper (nested) relations. An example is the include path
Composition.section.content, where the content reference on the highest level
Section is included, but also those reachable via the nested section relationship.
Likewise, Questionnaire.group.subject will return all subject on all Groups,
including those reachable by the deeper path via the nested Question and
nested Groups within those questions.
</p>
<p>
Include paths may include wild cards, such as MedicationDispense.results.*, or even _include=*,
though both clients and servers need to take care not to request or return too many resources
when doing this. Most notably, re-applying inclusion paths over newly included resources
might lead to cycles or the retrieval of the full patient's file: resources are
organized into an interlinked network and broad _include paths may eventually traverse all
possible paths on the server. For servers, these recursive and wildcard _includes are
demanding and may slow the search response time significantly. Servers are expected to
limit the number of iterations done and are not obliged to honor requests to include
additional resources in the search results.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>: for a server, it would generally only be required perform one iteration per
_include parameter
</p>

<h4>External References</h4>
<p>
If the _include path selects a reference that refers to a resource on another server,
the server can elect to include that resource in the search results for the convenience
of the client.
</p>
<p>
If the _include path selects a reference that refers to an entity that is not a Resource
(e.g. an image attachment), the server may also elect to include this in the returned
results as a <a href="extras.html#binary">Binary</a> resource. For example, the include
path may point to an attachment which is by reference, like this:
</p>
<pre>
 &lt;content&gt;
   &lt;contentType&gt;image/jpeg&lt;/contentType&gt;
   &lt;url&gt;http://example.org/images/2343434/234234.jpg&lt;/url&gt;
 &lt;/content&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The server can retrieve the target of this reference, and add this to the
results for the convenience of the client.
</p>

<a name="dstu-2"> </a>
<blockquote>
<p><b>DSTU Note</b>: HL7 is seeking feedback from implementers about whether additional
rules should be made about how _include works, based on implementation experience.
</p>
</blockquote>


<h4>Paging</h4>
<p>
When returning paged results for a search with _include resources, all _include resources that are
related to the primary resources returned for the page SHOULD also be returned as part of that
same page, even if some of those resource instances have previously been returned on previous
pages.  This allows both sender and receiver to avoid caching results of other pages.
</p>

<a name="summary"> </a>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>
The client can request the server to return a summary portion of the resources
only using the parameter "_summary":
</p>
<pre>
   GET [base]/ValueSet?_summary=true
</pre>
<p>
The <i>_summary</i> parameter requests the server to return only the elements marked
as "summary" in their definition. This is used to reduce the total processing load on
server, client, and resources between them such as the network. It is most useful for
resources that can be large, particularly ones that include images or elements that
may repeat many times.
</p>
<p>
Servers are not obliged to return just a summary, and summaries are not defined for
resources where there is no need for summarization. There is only one summary form
defined for each resource in order to allow servers to store the summarized form in
advance.
</p>

<a name="conformance" />
<h3>Server Conformance</h3>
<p>
In order to allow the client to be confident about what search parameters
were used as a criteria by the server, the server SHALL return the parameters
that were actually used to process the search. Applications processing search
results SHALL check these returned values where necessary. For example, if
the server did not support some of the filters specified in the search, a
client might manually apply those filters to the retrieved result set,
display a warning message to the user or take some other action.
</p>
<p>
In the case of a RESTful search, these parameters are encoded in the
self link in the atom feed that is returned:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;link&gt;
    &lt;relation value="self"/&gt;
    &lt;url value="http://example.org/Patient?name=peter"/&gt;
  &lt;/link&gt;
</pre>
<p>
In other respects, servers have considerable discretion with regards
to supporting search:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Servers can choose which parameters to support (other than _id above)</li>
 <li>Servers can choose when and where to implement parameter chaining, and when and where they support the _include parameter</li>
 <li>Servers are able to declare additional parameters in the profiles referenced from their conformance statements. Servers should define search parameters
    starting with a "-" character to ensure that the names they choose do not clash with future parameters defined by this specification</li>
 <li>Servers are not required to enforce case sensitivity on parameter names, though the names are case sensitive (and URLs are generally case-sensitive)</li>
 <li>Servers may choose how many results to return, though the client can use _count as above</li>
 <li>Servers can choose how to sort the return results, though they SHOULD honor the _sort parameter</li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<a name="advanced"> </a>
<h3>Advanced Search</h3>
<p>
The search framework described above is a useful framework
for providing a simple search based on indexed criteria,
but more sophisticated query capability is needed to handle precise
queries, complex decision support based requests, and
direct queries that have human resolution.
</p>
<p>
More advanced search operations are specified by the
_query parameter:
</p>
<pre>
   GET [base]/Patient?_query=name&amp;parameters...
</pre>
<p>
The _query parameter names a custom search profile that
describes a specific query operation. The named query
may define additional named parameters that are used with that
particular named query. Servers can define their own additional
named queries to meet their own uses using a <a href="operationdefinition.html">OperationDefinition</a>.
</p>
<p>
There can only ever be one _query parameter in a set of search
parameters. Servers processing search requests SHALL
refuse to process a search request if they do not recognize
the _query parameter value.
</p>

<h3>Executing Searches</h3>
<p>
In addition to the standard <a href="http.html#search">search</a> operation on a
RESTful interface (as described above), searches can also be performed using
the messaging framework.
</p>
<p>
<i>TODO: describe how this is done</i>
</p>

<a name="currency"> </a>
<h3>Search Result Currency</h3>

<p>
The results of a search operation are only guaranteed to be current
at the moment the operation is executed. After the operation is executed,
ongoing actions performed on the resources against which the search was
executed will render the results increasingly stale. The significance
of this depends on the nature of the search, and the kind of use that
is being made of the results.
</p>
<p>
This is particularly relevant when the server is returning the results
in a series of pages. It is at the discretion of the search engine
how to handle ongoing updates to the resources while the search
is proceeding.
</p>
<p>
Note that performing a search operation does not change the set of
resources on the server, with the exception of the creation
of <a href="auditevent.html">Audit Event</a> resources
auditing the search itself.
