<h2>Representing Resources in JSON</h2>
<p>
Though the FHIR resources are described using a representation based on XML, this 
specification also defines a JSON representation of the resources. The JSON format 
for the resources follows the standard XML format very closely to make interconversion 
easy, and so that XPath queries can easily be mapped to query the JSON structures. 
The formal mime type for this format is application/json+fhir.
</p>
<p>
Clients are free to choose whether to implement in XML or JSON. Servers SHALL support XML, and can 
choose to support JSON. Note that systems SHALL declare which format(s) they 
support in their <a href="conformance.htm">Conformance Statement</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The JSON representation is described relative to the XML representation:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The names for the JSON object members are the same as the names of the elements and attributes in XML, including for elements that may repeat. Property names are case sensitive</li>
 <li>Just as in XML, JSON property attributes never have empty values; omit a value if it is empty</li>
</ul>

<p>There are differences too:</p>
<ul>
 <li>There are no namespaces in the JSON representation</li>
 <li>The type of the resource is represented differently in JSON</li>
 <li>The order of properties of an object not significant in the JSON representation, though order within an array SHALL be maintained</li>
 <li>JSON does not have a notion of attributes versus elements, so attributes (xml:id, value) are handled differently</li>
 <li>JSON has a notation for arrays, which are used to represent repeating elements. Note that arrays are used when the item might repeat, even if they does not repeat in a specific instance</li>
 <li>The XHTML &lt;div&gt; element in the Narrative datatype is represented as a single escaped string of XHTML. This is to avoid problems in JSON with mixed content etc. The XHTML most still conform to the rules described for <a href="narrative.html">the Narrative</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These differences - particularly the repeating element one, which cannot be avoided - mean that generic XML --&gt; JSON converters are not 
able to perform correctly. The <a href="downloads.html#refimpl">reference platforms</a> provide XML &lt;--&gt; JSON conversion functionality that accommodates these FHIR-specific characteristics.</p>

<h3>JSON Representation for repeating elements</h3>

<p>
An element that has a maximum cardinality of x..* may occur more than once in the instance.
In XML, this is simply done by repeating the XML element multiple times. In JSON, this is
done by using an array type. Note that:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The name of the array is singular - the same as the XML element</li>
 <li>An item that may repeat is represented as an array even in the case that it doesn't so that the process of parsing the resource is the same either way</li>
</ul>
<pre class="xml">
 &lt;<b>coding</b>&gt;
   &lt;<b>system</b> value="http://snomed.info/id"/&gt;
   &lt;<b>code</b> value="104934005"/&gt;
 &lt;/<b>coding</b>/&gt;
 &lt;<b>coding</b>&gt;
   &lt;<b>system</b> value="http://loinc.org"/&gt;
   &lt;<b>code</b> value="2947-0"/&gt;
 &lt;/<b>coding</b>/&gt;
</pre>
<p>is represented in JSON like this:</p>
<pre class="json">
 "coding": [
   {
     "system" : "http://snomed.info/id",
     "code" : "104934005"
   },
   {
     "system" : "http://loinc.org",
     "code" : "2947-0"
   }
 ]
</pre>

<h3>JSON representation of primitive elements</h3>
<p>
FHIR elements with primitive values are represented in two parts:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A json property with the name of the element, which has a JSON type of number, boolean, or string</li>
 <li>a json property with "_" prepended to the name of the element, which, if present, contains the value's xml:id and/or extensions</li>
</ul>
<p>
The FHIR types <a href="datatypes.html#integer">integer</a> and <a href="datatypes.html#decimal">decimal</a> are represented as a JSON number, the FHIR type <a href="datatypes.html#boolean">boolean</a>
as a JSON boolean, and all other types are represented as a JSON String which has the same content as that specified for the relevant data type. Whitespace is always significant 
(i.e. no leading and trailing spaces for non-strings). 
</p>
<pre class="xml">
 &lt;<b>code</b> value="abc"/&gt; &lt;!-- code --&gt;
 &lt;<b>date</b> value="1972-11-30"/&gt; &lt;!-- dateTime --&gt;
 &lt;<b>deceased</b> value="false" /&gt; &lt;!-- boolean --&gt;
 &lt;<b>count</b> value="23" /&gt;  &lt;!-- integer --&gt;
</pre>
<p>is represented in JSON as</p>
<pre class="json">
 "code" : "abc",
 "date" : "1972-11-30",
 "deceased" : false,
 "count" : 23
</pre>
<p>
If the value has an id attribute, or extensions, then this is represented as follows:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
 &lt;<b>dob</b> id="314159" value="1970-03-30" &gt;
   &lt;extension&gt;
     &lt;url value="http://example.org/fhir/extensions#text"/&gt;
     &lt;valueString value="Easter 1970"/&gt;     
   &lt;/extension&gt;
 &lt;/<b>dob</b>&gt;
</pre>
<p>is represented in JSON as:</p>
<pre class="json">
 "dob": "1972-11-30",
 "_dob": { 
   "id": "314159", 
   "extension": {
      "url" : "http://example.org/fhir/extensions#text",
      "valueString" : "Easter 1970"
   }
 }
</pre>
<p>
In the case where the primitive element may repeat, it is represented 
in two arrays. null values are used to fill out the second array so 
that the id and/or extension are aligned with the matching value in 
the first array, as demonstrated in this example:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
 &lt;<b>code</b> value="au"/&gt;
 &lt;<b>code</b> value="nz"&gt;
   &lt;extension&gt;
     &lt;url value="http://hl7.org/fhir/tools/extensions#display"/&gt;
     &lt;valueString value="New Zealand a.k.a Kiwiland"/&gt;     
   &lt;/extension&gt;
 &lt;/<b>code</b>&gt;
</pre>
<p>is represented in JSON as:</p>
<pre class="json">
 "code": [ "au", "nz" ],
 "_code": [
   null, 
   { "extension": {
      "url" : "http://example.org/fhir/extensions#text",
      "valueString" : "New Zealand a.k.a Kiwiland"
   } ]
 }
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
Design Note: The representation of primitive data types has been 
split into two parts like this in order to simplify the representation 
of simple primitive values without id or extensions. This does have the cost of making the 
representation of the id attribute and extensions more ungainly, but these are both 
rarely used with primitive data types.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>JSON representation of Elements, and Complex Data types</h3>

<p>
Elements, and complex <a href="datatypes.html">datatypes</a> (types that contain named elements of other types) are represented using 
a JSON object, containing a member for each element in the datatype. Composites can have id attributes, which are 
converted to JSON member values, in the same manner as described for primitives. For example:</p>
 <pre class="xml">
&lt;person&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;
    &lt;status value="generated" /&gt;
    &lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;
    &lt;use value="official" /&gt;  
    &lt;given value="Karen" /&gt;
    &lt;family id="a2" value="Van" /&gt;
  &lt;/name&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
</pre>
<p>is represented in JSON as:</p>
<pre class="json">
{
  "person" : {
    "name" : [{
      "use" : "official" ,
      "given" : [ "Karen" ],
      "family" : [ "Van" ]
      "_family" : [ {"id" : "a2"} ]
     }],
    "text" : {
      "status" : "generated" ,
      "div" : "&lt;div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Things to note here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both given and family are repeating XML elements, so they are serialised as an Array whether or not they repeat in this instance</li>
<li>In the family part of 'name', the 'id' is added represented in _family as described above</li>
<li>The XHTML content in the 'div' element which is in the Narrative element 'text' is represented  
  as an escaped string in the value property in JSON. The xhtml's root element needs to be a &lt;div&gt; in the xhtml namespace</li>
</ul>

<h3>JSON representation of Resources</h3>
<p>
A resource is a JSON object with a property "resourceType" which informs the 
parser which resource type this is:
</p>
<pre class="json">
{
  "resourceType" : "Patient",
  "text" : {
    "status" : "generated" ,
    "div" : "&lt;div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
  }
  etc...
}
</pre>
<p>
Note that parsers cannot assume that the resourceType property will come first - many JSON frameworks do not give the author 
control over the order in which properties are written. 
</p>

<a name="bundle"> </a>
<a name="atom"> </a>
<a name="json-bundles"></a>
<h3>JSON Bundle Representation</h3>

<p>
In JSON <a href="extras.html#bundle">bundles</a> are represented using a JSON format that is tailored to the specific needs for bundles. 
Each element in the Xml feed definition has a JSON corresponding JSON object member with the same name. For convenience, a bundle has a 
"resourceType" property with the value of "Bundle". Here is an example feed returning search results for a person query:
</p>

<pre class="json">
{
  &quot;resourceType&quot; : &quot;Bundle&quot;,
  &quot;title&quot; : &quot;Search result&quot;,
  &quot;updated&quot; : &quot;2012-09-20T12:04:45.6787909+00:00&quot;,
  &quot;id&quot; : &quot;urn:uuid:50ea3e5e-b6a7-4f55-956c-caef491bbc08&quot;,
  &quot;link&quot; : [{
    &quot;rel&quot; : &quot;self&quot;,
  &quot;href&quot; : &quot;http://ip-0a7a5abe:16287/fhir/person?format=json&quot;
  }],
 <a name="tags"> </a>&quot;category&quot; : [{
    &quot;term&quot; : &quot;[Tag Term]&quot;,
    &quot;label&quot; : &quot;[Tag Label]&quot;,
    &quot;scheme&quot; : &quot;[Tag Scheme]&quot;
  }],
  &quot;totalResults&quot; : 12,
  &quot;entry&quot; : [{
    &quot;title&quot; : &quot;Resource of type Person, with id = 1 and version = 1&quot;,
    &quot;link&quot; : [{
      &quot;rel&quot; : &quot;self&quot;,
      &quot;href&quot; : &quot;http://fhir.furore.com/fhir/person/@1/history/1&quot;
    }],
    &quot;id&quot; : &quot;http://fhir.furore.com/fhir/person/@1&quot;,
    &quot;updated&quot; : &quot;2012-05-29T23:45:32+00:00&quot;,
    &quot;published&quot; : &quot;2012-09-20T12:04:47.3012429+00:00&quot;,
    &quot;author&quot; : [{
      &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Grahame Grieve / HL7 publishing committee&quot;
    }],
    &quot;category&quot; : [{
      &quot;term&quot; : &quot;[Tag Uri]&quot;,
      &quot;label&quot; : &quot;[Tag Label]&quot;,
      &quot;scheme&quot; : &quot;[Tag Type]&quot;
    }],
    &quot;content&quot; : {
      &quot;Person&quot; : { ...person content in JSON... }
    },
    &quot;summary&quot; : &quot;&lt;div xmlns=\&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\&quot;&gt;(text summary)&lt;/div&gt;&quot;,
  },
  ... other entries ....
  ]
}
</pre>

<p>
Note that property names for elements that can repeat are not pluralized for consistency of overall approach (as described above). 
The mime type for a json bundle is also application/json+fhir.
</p>

<a name="json-bundle-delete"> </a>
<h4>Bundling versions - deletion</h4>
<p>
When returning a set of versions for a resource, a version might indicate a deletion. 
While the XML format follows <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6721.txt">RFC 6721</a>,
the JSON format needs to use an entry item to retain the logical order of entries:</p>
<pre class="json">
   .. feed ..
   &quot;entry&quot; : [
    ... other entries ....,    
    {
      &quot;deleted&quot; : &quot;2012-05-29T23:45:32+00:00&quot;,
      &quot;id&quot; : &quot;http://fhir.furore.com/fhir/person/@1&quot;,
      &quot;link&quot; : [{
          &quot;rel&quot; : &quot;self&quot;,
          &quot;href&quot; : &quot;http://fhir.furore.com/fhir/person/@1/history/1&quot;
        }],
    }, ... other entries ....
  ]
  ... feed ...
</pre>
<p>
The entry is known to be deleted because a date of deletion is given. An id SHALL be provided, and a link may be provided.
</p>

<a name="binary"> </a>
<h4>Binary Resources</h4>
<p>
There are situations where it is useful or required to handle pure binary content 
as resources. Typically, this is when the binary content is referred to from other FHIR 
Resources. The resource can contain any content, whether text, image, pdf, zip archive, etc. 
These resources are <a href="http.html#binary">served in their native form on the rest interface</a>,
but can also be represented in XML or JSON, such as when including these resources in a bundle
(used when it is convenient to include these in the feed directly rather than leaving them by reference).
</p>
<p>
In JSON, Binary resources are represented like this:
</p>
<pre class="json">
  &quot;Binary&quot; : {
    &quot;contentType&quot; : &quot;[mime type]&quot;,
    &quot;content&quot; : &quot;[base64 of data]&quot;
  }
</pre>
