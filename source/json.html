<h2>JSON Representation of Resources</h2>

<p>
The JSON representation for a resource is based on the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/std90">JSON format described in STD 90 (RFC 8259)</a>, and is described using this format:
</p>

<pre class="spec">{
  "resourceType" : "<a title="The resource type being referenced" class="dict" href="resourcelist.html"><b>[Resource Type]</b></a>",
  "resourceDefinition" : "<a title="The resource definition for additional resources" class="dict" href="resource.html#additional">(see below)</a>",
  // from <a href="json.html">Source</a>: <a href="json.html">property0</a>
  "<a title="long description" class="dict" href="json.html">property1</a>" : "&lt;<span style="color: darkgreen"><a href="datatypes.html">[primitive]</a></span>&gt;", <span style="color: Gray">//</span> <span style="color: navy; opacity: 0.8">short description</span>
  "<a title="long description" class="dict" href="json.html">property2</a>" : { <span style="color: darkgreen"><a href="datatypes.html">[Datatype]</a></span> }, <span style="color: Gray">//</span> <span style="color: navy; opacity: 0.8">short description</span>
  "<a title="long description" class="dict" href="json.html">property3</a>" : { <span style="color: Gray">//</span> <span style="color: navy; opacity: 0.8">Short Description</span>
    "<a title="long description" class="dict" href="json.html">propertyA</a>" : { <span style="color: darkgreen"><a href="datatypes.html#CodeableConcept">CodeableConcept</a></span> }, <span style="color: Gray">//</span> <span style="color: navy; opacity: 0.8"><a style="color: navy; opacity: 0.8" href="json.html">Short Description</a> (<a style="color: navy; opacity: 0.8" href="terminologies.html#example">Example</a>)</span>
  },
  "<a title="long description" class="dict" href="json.html">property4</a>" : [{ <span style="color: Gray">//</span> <span style="color: navy; opacity: 0.8">Short Description</span>
    "<a title="long description" class="dict" href="json.html">propertyB</a>" : { <span style="color: darkgreen"><a href="references.html#Reference">Reference</a>(<a href="resourcelist.html">ResourceType</a>)</span> } <span style="color: Gray">//</span> <span title="This element is required" style="color: brown"><b>R!</b></span>  <span style="color: navy; opacity: 0.8">Short Description</span>
  }]
}
</pre>
<p>
Using this format:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>To build a valid JSON instance of a resource, replace the contents of the property values with valid content
   as described by the type rules and content description found in the property value for each element</li>
 <li>In this example:
   <ol>
     <li><code>property1</code> has a primitive datatype; the value of the property will be as described for the stated type</li>
     <li><code>property2</code> has a complex datatype; the value of the property is an object that has the content as described for the stated type</li>
     <li><code>property3</code> is an object property that contains additional properties (e.g., propertyA; the allowable properties are listed, and also include extensions as appropriate)</li>
     <li><code>property4</code> is an array property that contains items which are objects themselves. The items may have any of the types already encountered in points 1-3</li>
     <li><code>propertyA</code> is an example of an object property that has a binding to a value set - the Short description is a link to the value set. In addition, the binding strength is shown </li>
     <li><code>propertyB</code> is an example of an object property that has a reference to a particular kind of resource </li>
   </ol>
 </li>
 <li>Property names are case-sensitive (though duplicates that differ only in case are never defined)</li>
 <li>Property names SHALL be unique. Note: this is not explicitly stated in the original JSON specification,so stated for clarity here</li>
 <li>Properties can appear in any order</li>
 <li>XHTML is represented as an escaped string</li>
 <li>Objects are never empty. If an element is present in the resource, it SHALL have properties as defined for its type, or 1 or more <a href="extensibility.html">extensions</a></li>
 <li>String property values can never be empty. Either the property is absent, or it is present with at least one character of content</li>
 <li>The <span style="color: brown"><b>R!</b></span> denotes that an element is mandatory - it must be present (or in an array, at least one item must be present)</li>
 <li>In this format, <code>//</code> is used for comments. While // is legal in Javascript, it is not legal in JSON, and comments SHALL NOT be in JSON instances irrespective of whether particular applications ignore them</li>
 <li>The character encoding is always UTF-8</li>
 <li>The MIME-type for this format is <code>application/fhir+json</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Given the way <a href="extensibility.html">extensions</a> work, applications reading
JSON resources will never encounter unknown properties. However, once an application
starts trading with other applications that conform to later versions of this specification,
unknown properties may be encountered. Applications MAY choose to ignore unknown properties
in order to foster forwards compatibility in this regard, but may also choose not to.
<!-- Applications declare their behavior with regard to unknown elements using
<a href="capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.acceptUnknown">CapabilityStatement.acceptUnknown</a>. -->
</p>


<a name="additional"></a>
<h3>JSON representation of additional resources</h3>

<p>
When <a href="resource.html#additional">additional resources</a> are represented in JSON, the
resourceType property contains the name of the resource as allocated by HL7, and an additional
property is present, <code>resourceDefinition</code>. The resourceDefinition value is a 
canonical reference to the definition of the resource and always includes the version explicitly,
e.g.,  
</p>

<pre class="json">
{
  "resourceType" : "ViewDefinition",
  "resourceDefinition" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sql-on-fhir/StructureDefinition/ViewDefinition|2.0.0-pre",
  "id": "a-valid-id",
  // etc
}
</pre>

<p>
The <code>resourceDefinition</code> property is a feature of the JSON format, and is not defined anywhere 
in the structural definitions of FHIR (in the same way that the <code>resourceType</code> property is not).
The resourceDefinition property is not present if the resourceType is one defined in this specification.
</p>
<a name="repeat"></a>
<h3>JSON Representation for repeating elements</h3>

<a name="xml"></a>
<p>
Note that this page contains some XML examples for the purposes of 
comparison between the two formats. The formats page has 
a <a href="resource-formats.html#comparison">comparison between the JSON and XML formats</a>.
</p>

<p>
An element that has a maximum cardinality of >1 (e.g., <code>x..*</code> in the definitions) may occur more than once in the instance.
In JSON, this is done by using an array type. Note that:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The name of the array is singular</li>
 <li>An item that may repeat is represented as an array even in the case that it doesn't repeat so that the process of parsing the resource is the same either way</li>
 </ul>

<p>So a <a href="datatypes.html#CodeableConcept">CodeableConcept</a> is represented in JSON like this:</p>

<pre class="json" fragment="CodeableConcept">
{
 "coding": [
   {
     "system" : "http://snomed.info/sct",
     "code" : "104934005"
   },
   {
     "system" : "http://loinc.org",
     "code" : "2947-0"
   }
 ]
}
</pre>
<p>
XML for comparison:
</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="CodeableConcept">
  &lt;code&gt;
    &lt;coding&gt;
      &lt;system value="http://snomed.info/sct"/&gt;
      &lt;code value="104934005"/&gt;
    &lt;/coding&gt;
    &lt;coding&gt;
      &lt;system value="http://loinc.org"/&gt;
      &lt;code value="2947-0"/&gt;
    &lt;/coding&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;
 </pre>
 
[%dragons-start%]
<p>
NOTE: Elements may change whether they are allowed to repeat or not between versions, even once normative 
(see <a href="versions.html#f-compat-cardianality">cardinality rules for backward compatibility)</a>).
</p>
<p>  Processors should be prepared to manage such changes.

<h3>JSON representation of primitive elements</h3>
<p>
FHIR elements with primitive datatypes are represented in two parts:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A JSON property with the name of the element, which has a JSON type of number, boolean, or string</li>
 <li>a JSON property with <code>_</code> prepended to the name of the element, which, if present, contains the value's id and/or extensions</li>
</ul>
<p>
The FHIR types <a href="datatypes.html#integer">integer</a>, <a href="datatypes.html#unsignedInt">unsignedInt</a>, 
<a href="datatypes.html#positiveInt">positiveInt</a> and <a href="datatypes.html#decimal">decimal</a> are represented 
as a JSON number, the FHIR type <a href="datatypes.html#boolean">boolean</a>
as a JSON boolean, and all other types (including <a href="datatypes.html#integer64">integer64</a>) are represented as a JSON string which has the same content as that specified for the relevant datatype. Whitespace is always significant
(i.e., no leading and trailing spaces for non-strings).</p>
<pre class="json">
 "code" : "abc",
 "birthDate" : "1972-11-30",
 "deceased" : false,
 "count" : 23
 }
</pre>
<p>For comparison, this is represented in XML as</p>
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;<b>code</b> value="abc"/&gt; &lt;!-- code --&gt;
  &lt;<b>birthDate</b> value="1972-11-30"/&gt; &lt;!-- dateTime --&gt;
  &lt;<b>deceased</b> value="false" /&gt; &lt;!-- boolean --&gt;
  &lt;<b>count</b> value="23" /&gt;  &lt;!-- integer --&gt;
 </pre>
 <a name="decimal"></a>
[%dragons-start%]
<p>
When using a JavaScript JSON.parse() implementation, note that JavaScript natively supports only one numeric datatype, which is a floating point number.
This can cause loss of precision for FHIR numbers. In particular, trailing 0s after a decimal point will be lost e.g., 2.00 will be converted to 2.
The FHIR decimal datatype is defined such that precision, including trailing zeros, is preserved for presentation purposes, and this
is widely regarded as critical for correct presentation of clinical measurements. Implementations should consider using a custom parser and big number library
(e.g., <a href="https://github.com/jtobey/javascript-bignum">https://github.com/jtobey/javascript-bignum</a>) to meet these requirements.
See also <a href="[%extensions-location%]StructureDefinition-quantity-precision.html">the precision extension</a>.
</p>
[%dragons-end%]

<p>
If the value has an id attribute, or extensions, then this is represented as follows:
</p>
<pre class="json">
 "birthDate": "1970-03-30",
 "_birthDate": {
   "id": "314159",
   "extension" : [ {
      "url" : "http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/text",
      "valueString" : "Easter 1970"
   }]
 }
</pre>
<p>Note: If the primitive has an id attribute or extension, but no value, only the property with the <code>_</code> is rendered.</p>
<p>This is represented in XML as:</p>
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;<b>birthDate</b> id="314159" value="1970-03-30" &gt;
    &lt;extension url="http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/text"&gt;
      &lt;valueString value="Easter 1970"/&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
  &lt;/<b>birthDate</b>&gt;
 </pre>
 
 <p>
In the case where the primitive element may repeat, it is represented
in two arrays. JSON null values are used to fill out both arrays so
that the id and/or extension are aligned with the matching value in
the first array, as demonstrated in this example:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
 &lt;<b>code</b> value="au"/&gt;
 &lt;<b>code</b> value="nz"&gt;
   &lt;extension url="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/display"&gt;
     &lt;valueString value="New Zealand a.k.a Kiwiland"/&gt;
   &lt;/extension&gt;
 &lt;/<b>code</b>&gt;
</pre>
<p>is represented in JSON as:</p>
<pre class="json">
 "code": [ "au", "nz" ],
 "_code": [
   null,
   {
     "extension" : [ {
        "url" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/display",
        "valueString" : "New Zealand a.k.a Kiwiland"
     }]
   }
  ]
</pre>
<a name="null"></a>

<p>Note: when one of the repeating elements has no value, it is represented in the first array using a null. When
an element has a value but no extension/id, the second array will have a null at the position of that element.
If the length of a JSON "element" array is different from the length of its JSON "_element" array, 
implementations SHALL infer null values in the suffix of the shorter array. If an array has only null elements,
implementations SHOULD omit it entirely.
</p>

[%impl-note%]
The representation of primitive datatypes has been
split into two parts like this in order to simplify the representation
of simple primitive values without id or extensions. This does have the cost of making the
representation of the id attribute and extensions more ungainly, but these are both
rarely used with primitive datatypes.
[%end-note%]

<a name="complex"></a>

<h3>JSON representation of Complex Datatypes and XHTML</h3>

<p>
Complex <a href="datatypes.html">datatypes</a> (types that contain named elements of other types) are represented using
a JSON object that contains a property for each element in the datatype. Complex datatypes can have ids, which are
converted to JSON properties, in the same manner as described for primitives. For example:</p>
 <pre class="xml" fragment="Patient">
&lt;Patient&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;
    &lt;status value="generated" /&gt;
    &lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;name id="f2"&gt;
    &lt;use value="official" /&gt;
    &lt;given value="Karen" /&gt;
    &lt;family id="a2" value="Van" /&gt;
  &lt;/name&gt;
&lt;/Patient&gt;
</pre>
<p>is represented in JSON as:</p>
<pre class="json" fragment="Patient">
{
  "resourceType" : "Patient",
  "name" : [{
    "id" : "f2",
    "use" : "official" ,
    "given" : [ "Karen" ],
    "family" :  "Van",
    "_family" : {"id" : "a2"}
  }],
  "text" : {
    "status" : "generated" ,
    "div" : "&lt;div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Things to note here are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>given</code> is a repeating element, so it is serialized as an Array, whether or not it repeats in this instance</li>
<li>In the family part of <code>name</code>, the <code>id</code> is added represented in <code>_family</code> as described above, while the <code>id</code> on the name itself is represented as just another property</li>
<li>The order of JSON properties may differ from the order in the specification</li>
<li>The XHTML content in the <code>div</code> element which is in the Narrative element <code>text</code> is represented
  as an escaped string in the value property in JSON. The xhtml root element SHALL be a &lt;div&gt; in the xhtml namespace</li>
</ul>

<a name="resources"></a>

<h3>JSON representation of Resources</h3>
<p>
A resource is a JSON object with a property <code>resourceType</code> which informs the
parser which resource type this is:
</p>
<pre class="json" fragment="Patient">
{
  "resourceType" : "Patient",
  "text" : {
    "status" : "generated" ,
    "div" : "&lt;div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
  }
  // etc...
}
</pre>
<p>
Note that parsers cannot assume that the resourceType property will come first.
</p>
[%impl-note%]
This is a problem for several JSON -&gt; Object serializers that assume that the
resourceType property does come first, including <a href="http://james.newtonking.com/json">Json.NET</a>.
However, some JSON generators do not give the authoring application control of the order of the
property values, and so these implementations cannot interoperate with implementations that make
assumptions about order. Given that JSON says that the property values are an unordered map of name/value
pairs, this specification cannot require that properties come in any particular order, though implementers
may choose to fix the property order if they are able (and the reference platforms provided with this
specification do so).
