<p>
The XDS profile describes in detail how a <a href="documentreference.htm">DocumentReference</a> resource 
is used in the context of XDS. A FHIR DocumentReference resource may be used as a facade to an existing
XDS server, such as is used for the <a href="http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Mobile_access_to_Health_Documents_(MHD)">IHE MHD</a> specification,
or it can be used the other way around, where the XDS functionality is implemented using a FHIR based server.
</p>
<p>
The FHIR DocumentReference is based on the functionality defined by XDS, but differs from XDS in 
some significant ways:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>As a RESTful interface, there is no concept of "Submission Set" - only document entry is represented explicitly, though a <a href="http.htm#transaction">transaction</a> may be used to group a set of documents together</li>
 <li>Patient, Author and Authenticator are represented using standard <a href="patient.htm">Patient</a> and <a href="practitioner.htm">Practitioner</a> resources.</li>
 <li>The functionality expressed through the XDSFolder resource is implemented using <a href="extras.htm#tags">tags</a></li>
 <li>Some XDS specific fields that are not generally applicable do not have matching elements in the DocumentReference resource, and are implemented as FHIR extensions</li>
</ul>
