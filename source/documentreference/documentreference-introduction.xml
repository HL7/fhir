<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
A DocumentReference resource is used to index a document, clinical note, and other binary objects such as a photo, video, or audio recording, including those resulting from diagnostic or care provision procedures, to make them available to a healthcare system. A document is some sequence of bytes that is identifiable, establishes its own context (e.g., what subject, author, etc. can be presented to the user), and has defined update management. The DocumentReference resource can be used with any document format that has a recognized mime type and that conforms to this definition.
</p>
<p>
Typically, DocumentReference resources are used in document indexing systems, such as <a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-10.html>"IHE XDS</a> and as profiled in <a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/">IHE Mobile Access to Health Documents</a>.
</p>
<p>
DocumentReference contains metadata, inline content or direct references to documents such as:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">CDA</a> documents in FHIR systems</li>
 <li><a href="documents.html">FHIR documents</a> stored elsewhere (i.e. registry/repository following the XDS model)</li>
 <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">PDF documents</a>, Scanned Paper, and digital records of faxes</li>
 <li>Clinical Notes in various forms</li>
 <li>Image files (e.g., JPEG, GIF, TIFF)</li>
 <li>Video files (e.g., MP4, WMV)</li>
 <li>Audio files (e.g., WAV, MP3)</li>
 <li>Non-Standard formats (e.g., CSV, RTF, WORD)</li>
 <li>Other kinds of documents, such as records of prescriptions or immunizations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
FHIR defines both a <a href="documents.html">document format</a> and this document reference. FHIR documents are for documents
that are authored and assembled in FHIR. DocumentReference is intended for general references to any type of media file <em>including</em> assembled documents.
</p>
<p>
The document that is a target of the reference can be a reference to a FHIR document served by another server, or
the target can be stored in the special <a href="http.html#binary">FHIR Binary Resource</a>, or the target can be
stored on some other server system. The document reference is also able to address documents that are retrieved
by a service call such as an XDS.b RetrieveDocumentSet, or a DICOM exchange, or an <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=185">HL7 v2</a> message query - though
the way each of these service calls works must be specified in some external standard or other documentation.
</p>
<p>
A <code>DocumentReference</code> describes some other document. This means that there are two sets of
provenance information relevant here: the provenance of the document, and the provenance of the document
reference. Sometimes, the provenance information is closely related, as when the document producer also
produces the document reference, but in other workflows, the document reference is generated later by
other actors. In the <code>DocumentReference</code> resource, the <a href="resource.html#Meta">meta</a>
content refers to the provenance of the reference itself, while the content described below concerns
the document it references. Like all resources, there is overlap between the information in the
resource directly, and in the general <a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a> resource. This is
discussed as <a href="provenance.html#overlap">part of the description of the Provenance resource</a>.
