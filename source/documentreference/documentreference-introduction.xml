A document reference is a reference to a document defined in some other format, or stored in some other system.
Typically, Document Reference Resources are used in document indexing systems, such as IHE XDS (see the <a href="xds-profile.xml.htm">XDS specific profile</a>),
and also to refer to:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">CDA documents</a> in FHIR systems</li>
 <li><a href="document.htm">FHIR documents</a> stored elsewhere</li>
 <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">PDF documents</a>, and even digital records of faxes where sufficient information is available</li>
 <li>Other kinds of documents, such as records of prescriptions.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
FHIR defines both a <a href="document.htm">document format</a> and this document reference. FHIR documents are for documents 
that are authored and assembled in FHIR. This resource is for general references to other documents. 
</p>
<p>
Note that there is no formal or limited definition of what a document is. 
</p>

<p>
The document that is a target of the reference can be a reference to a FHIR document served by another server, or the target can be stored in the special <a href="http.htm#binary">FHIR Binary Resource</a>, or the target can be stored on some other server system. The document reference is also able to address documents that are retrieved by a service call such as an XDS.b RetrieveDocumentSet, or a DICOM exchange, or a v2 message query, though the way each of these works must be specified in an implementation guide.
