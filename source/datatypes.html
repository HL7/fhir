<h1>Data Types</h1>

<p>
The FHIR specification defines a set of data types that are used for the 
resource elements. There are two categories of data type: simple / primitive types, imported from XML schema, and complex types, which are re-usable clusters of elements.
This page describes the data types. See also the <a href="datatypes-examples.html">Examples</a>, <a href="datatypes-definitions.html">Formal Definitions</a> and 
<a href="datatypes-mappings.html">Mappings</a>.
</p>

[%diagram datatypes/alltypes.diagram%]

<p>
The data types are available as a <a href="fhir-base.xsd">W3C Schema</a>.

<a name="primitive"></a>
<h2>Primitive Types</h2>


[%diagram datatypes/primitives.diagram%]

<a name="imports"> </a>
<p>
The following table summarizes the primitive types and their simple restrictions that
are used in throughout this specification. Primitive types are those without sub-properties, though primitives, like all types, have <a href="extensibility.html">extensions</a>.
Primitive types have a value which has the same value domain as defined in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/">W3C Schema (1.0) specification part 2</a>, 
though in a few cases, this specification makes additional constraints marked in bold.

<p>
In addition to having a value as described above, these primitive data types can also have an identity (e.g. xml:id), 
and they may have <a href="extensibility.html">extensions</a> like any other element in a resource. Note that the 
value option is optional and might not be present, following the <a href="formats.html#element-rules">standard rules for all elements</a>.
For instance, a primitive element might have no value, and include a <a href="general-extensions.html#data-absent-reason">data-absent-reason extension</a> instead.
</p>
<p>
In XML, these types are represented as XML Elements with the value of the type in the value attribute. 
The name of the element is defined where the type is used. The XML elements may have an <a href="references.html#idref">id attribute</a>, and child elements named "extension". 
According to XML schema, leading and trailing whitespace in the value attribute is ignored for the types 
boolean, integer, decimal, base64Binary, instant, uri, date, dateTime, oid, and uri. Note that this means that the 
schema aware XML libraries give different attribute values to non schema aware libraries when reading the 
XML instances. For this reason, the value attribute for these types SHOULD not have leading and trailing spaces.
String values should only have leading and trailing spaces if they are part of the content of the value. 
</p>
<p>
In JSON, these types are represented as simple properties of the object that contains them. The name of the property is defined where the type is used.
The types still have an id property, and extensions. How these are represented is described in the <a href="json.html">JSON format</a>. Whitespace
is always significant in JSON. Primitive types other than string SHALL NOT have leading or trailing whitespace.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Types"/>
<h2>Complex Types</h2>

<p>
These types are represented as XML Elements with child elements with the name of the defined elements of the type. The name of the element is defined where the type is used. 
Any of the XML elements may have an <a href="references.html#idref">id attribute</a>. In JSON, the data type is represented by an object with properties named the same as the
XML elements. The JSON representation is almost exactly the same, so only the first <a href="datatypes-examples.html#Attachment">example</a> has an additional JSON representation.
</p>
<p>
Complex data types may be "profiled". A <a href="profile.html">profile</a> makes 
a set of rules about which elements SHALL have values, and what the possible 
values are.

<p>
This type is for containing or referencing attachments - additional data content defined in other 
formats. The most common use of this type is to include images or reports in 
some report format such as PDF. However it can be used for any 
data that has a mime type. 
</p>
[%dt Attachment%]
<p>
The <i>contentType</i> element SHALL always be populated. It can include charset information 
and other mime type extensions as appropriate. If there is no character set in the <i>contentType</i>
then the correct course of action is undefined, though some media types may define a default
character set and/or the correct character set may be able to be determined by inspection of the content.
</p>
<p>The actual content of the 
Attachment can be conveyed directly using the <i>data</i> element
or a <i>URL</i> reference can be provided. If both are provided, the reference SHALL 
point to the same content as found in the data. The reference can never be reused to point to
some different data (i.e. the reference is version specific). The
<i>URL</i> reference SHALL point to a location that resolves to actual data; some
URIs such as cid: meet this requirement. If the URL is a relative reference, it is interpreted
in the same way as a <a href="references.html#references">resource reference</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <i>hash</i> is included so that applications can verify that the content returned by the URL has not changed. 
</p>
<p>
In many cases where Attachment is used, the cardinality is &gt;1. A valid use of repeats is to convey the same content in different mime types and languages.
Guidance on the meaning of repeating elements SHALL be provided in the definition of the repeating resource element or extension that references this type.
The language element describes the language of the attachment using the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">codes defined in BCP 47</a>.

</p>
<p>
A Coding is a representation of a defined concept using a symbol from a defined "code system"
- see <a href="terminologies.html">Using Codes in resources</a> for more details.
</p>

[%dt Coding%]

<p>
The meaning of the Coding is defined by the code. The <i>system</i> provides
the source of the definition of the code, along with an optional version reference.
The display is a human display for the text defined by the system - it adds no other 
value. The Value Set reference provides context information about the selection of the 
code. 
</p>
<p>
The <i>system</i> is a URI that references the code system that defines the <i>code</i>. 
The URI may be: 
</p>
<ul>
 <li>a URI defined in the <a href="terminologies-systems.html">the named systems list</a></li>
 <li>an OID (urn:oid:) or a UUID (urn:uuid:). OIDs and UUIDs may be registered in the <a href="http://hl7.org/oid">HL7 OID registry</a></li>
 <li>a URL that references a definition of the system directly, which may be a reference to a code system defined as part of <a href="valueset.html">ValueSet</a> resource (i.e. the value in <i>ValueSet.define.system</i>)</li>
 <li>or any other URI that uniquely identifies the code system definition</li>
</ul>
<p>
The correct value to use in the <i>system</i> for a given code system can be determined by working through the following list, in order:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>the <a href="terminologies-systems.html">Named Systems List</a> section</li>
 <li>the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/oid/index.cfm?ref=common">HL7 OID Registry</a></li>
 <li>the documentation associated with the code system</li>
 <li>consulting the owner of the code system</li>
 <li>asking on the HL7 vocabulary mailing list</li>
</ul>
<p>
A code system version may also be supplied. If the meaning of codes within the code system is consistent across releases, this is not required. 
The version SHOULD be exchanged when this the system does not maintain consistent definitions across versions.
If a value set is referenced, and the value set defines the code system, and the code system definition specifies a version, the version SHALL be the same as in the value set. 
Note that the following systems SHOULD always have a version specified:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://loinc.org">LOINC</a></li>
 <li>Various versions of ICD</li>
 <li>National releases of SNOMED CT (consistency of definitions varies amongst jurisdications, and some jurisdictions may make their own rules on this)</li>
</ul>
<p>
See the <a href="valueset.html#versioning">discussion of code system versions in the Value Set resource</a> for further discussion on versioning.
</p>

<p>
If present, the <i>code</i> SHALL be a syntactically correct symbol as defined by the <i>system</i>.
In some code systems such as SNOMED CT, the symbol may be an expression composed of other predefined symbol (e.g. post-coordination). 
Note that codes are case sensitive unless specified otherwise by the code system. The <i>display</i> 
is a text representation of the code defined by the <i>system</i> and is used to display 
the meaning of the code by an application that is not aware of the <i>system</i>. 
</p>
<p>
Where the code system defines multiple possible display strings, one of these SHALL be used in <i>display</i>. 
If one is labelled as preferred, it SHOULD be used. If the code system does not define a text representation 
(e.g. SNOMED CT Expressions) then <i>display</i> cannot be populated, and the meaning of the code won't be 
accessible to systems that don't understand the code expression.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, the <i>system</i> may not be known - only the code is known. 
In this case, no useful processing of the code may be performed unless
the system can be safely inferred by the context. 
This practice should be avoided where possible, as 
information sharing in a wider context is very likely to arise eventually, and codes cannot
be used in the absence of a known system.
</p>
<p>
If the system is present, and there is no code, then this is understood to mean that there
is no suitable code in the system in which to represent the code. 
</p>
<p>
If two codings have the same <i>system</i>, <i>version</i> and <i>code</i> then they have the same meaning.
If the version information is missing, or the <i>system</i>, <i>version</i> or the <i>code</i> elements differ, then 
how they codes are related can only be determined by consulting the definitions of the system(s) and any <a href="conceptmap.html">mappings</a> available.
</p>
<p>
A coding may be marked as a "primary" if a user selected the particular coded value 
in a user interface (e.g. the user selects an item in a picklist). A primary
is the preferred choice for performing translations etc. 
</p>
<p>
A reference to a <a href="valueset.html">value set</a> may be provided to help a user or system processing the code
to understand the context in which the code arose. In some contexts, the possible
set of codes from which the code was chosen influences how the code should be 
interpreted. A value set reference is not an acceptable substitute for a logical
URI in the system, and the system URI SHALL not contain a reference to a value set. 
(If the value set defines its own codes, then the correct value for the 
system is <i>ValueSet.define.system</i>, and the value set contains a direct reference
to the value set resource.
</p>

<!--<h3>Version Management</h3>
<p>
Some code systems have periodic releases where the meanings of the codes are changed between
each release. Other code systems provide multiple releases where only minor consistent changes 
are allowed - mainly the addition of new codes. Finally, a few code systems provide an elaborate 
set of policies and procedures to allow concepts to be refined and modified within a single
definitional space. For the second two types of code system, it may help with implementation 
and interpretation tasks to track which minor release (version) of the code system is in use. 
</p>
<p>
For SNOMED CT, the minor release (and optionally module/release) are indicated as part of the 
<i>system</i> element using the http://snomed.info/sct identifier as defined by SNOMED CT. For
all other code systems, the <i>version</i> element is used to indicate the minor release. 
In the absence of a specified version release format by the code system (such as 2.36 for 
LOINC), the release date is to be used.
</p>
<p>
The <i>version</i> element SHALL always be ignored when comparing <i>Coding</i> values
</p>-->
<div class="use">
<p><b>Constraints</b></p>
<!--

Unless the Coding element has a dataAbsentReason flag, it SHALL contain a <i>system</i> element

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Design Note</b>: This specification defines two types for representing coded values:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Coding</b>: a simple direct reference to a code defined by a code system</li>
 <li><b>CodeableConcept</b>: a text description and/or a list of Codings (i.e.g a list of references to codes defned by codes systems)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <i>Coding</i> data type corresponds to the simple case of selecting 
a single code from a code list. However this type is rarely used in the 
FHIR specifications; long experience with exchanging coded values in
HL7 shows that in the general case, systems need to able to exchange
multiple translation codes, and/or an original text. 
</p>
<p>
The <i>Coding</i> data type is used directly  when there is certainty that the value 
must be selected directly from one of the available codes, and the list of 
possible codes is agreed to by all participants. This is not usually the case
in the context of FHIR - general interoperabiity - so Coding is mostly used
in extensions, which are usually intended to be defined for a well-controlled context of use.

</p>
<p>
A CodeableConcept represents a value that is usually supplied by providing a reference to one or more terminologies or ontologies, but may also be defined by the 
provision of text. This is a common pattern in healthcare data.
</p>
[%dt CodeableConcept%]
<p>
Each <i>coding</i> is a representation of the concept as described above. The concept may be coded multiple times in different code systems (or even 
multiple times in the same code systems, where multiple forms are possible, such as 
with SNOMED CT). The different codings may have slightly different granularity due to the differences 
in the definitions of the underlying codes. There is no meaning associated with the ordering of <i>coding</i> within a <i>CodeableConcept</i>. 
A typical use of <i>CodeableConcept</i> is to send the local code that the concept was coded with, and also one or more translations to publicly defined 
code systems such as LOINC or SNOMED CT. Sending local codes is useful and important for the purposes of debugging and integrity auditing.  
</p>
<p>
Whether or not <i>coding</i> elements are present, the <i>text</i> 
is the representation of the concept as entered or chosen by the user, and which most closely 
represents the intended meaning of the user or concept. Very often the <i>text</i> 
is the same as a <i>display</i> of one of the codings. One of the codings 
may be flagged as the primary - the code or concept that the user actually selected directly. 
When none of the <i>coding</i> elements is marked as primary, the text (if present)
is the preferred source of meaning.

<p>
Common factors in the numerator and denominator are not automatically cancelled out. The Ratio 
data type is used for titers (e.g., "1:128") and other quantities produced by laboratories that 
truly represent ratios. Ratios are not simply "structured numerics" - for example blood pressure measurements 
(e.g. "120/60") are not ratios. In addition, ratios are used where common factors in the numerator 
and denominator do not cancel out. The most common example of this is where the ratio represents a 
unit cost, and the numerator is a currency (e.g. 50/$10).
</p>
<p>
A proper ratio has both a numerator and a denominator; however these are not mandatory in order
to allow an invalid ratio with an extension with further information.

<p>
A time period defined by a start and end date/time.
</p>
<p>
A period specifies a range of times. The context
of use will specify whether the entire range applies (e.g. "the patient
was an inpatient of the hospital for this time range") or one value 
from the period applies (e.g. "give to the patient between 2 and 4 pm").
</p>
[%dt Period%]
<p>
If the <i>start</i> element is  missing, the start of the period is not
known. If the <i>end</i> element is missing, it means that the period is ongoing.
</p>
<p>
The end value includes any matching date/time. For example, the period 
2011-05-23 to 2011-05-27 includes all the times of 23rd May through to 
the end of the 27th May.

A SampledData provides a concise way to handle the data produced by devices that sample a physical particular state at a high frequency. A typical 
use for this is for the output of an ECG or EKG device.

The digits are a set of decimal values separated by a single space (Unicode character u20).
In addition to decimal values, the special values "E" (error), "L" (below detection limit) 
and "U" (above detection limit) can also be used. If there is more than one dimension, the
different dimensions are interlaced - all the data points for a particular time are
represented together.

<p>
A numeric or alphanumeric string that is associated with a single object or entity within a given system. 
Typically, identifiers are used to connect content in resources to external content available in other frameworks or protocols.
Typically, identifiers are used to connect content in resources to external content available in other frameworks or protocols.
Identifiers are associated with objects, and may be changed or retired due to human or system process and
errors. 
</p>

[%dt Identifier%]

<p>
The <i>system</i> referred to by means of a URI defines how the identifier is defined (i.e. how the value is made unique). 
It might be a specific application or a recognized standard/specification for a set or identifiers
or a way of making identifiers unique. The <i>value</i> SHALL be unique within the defined <i>system</i>
and have a consistent meaning wherever it appears. Both <i>system</i> and <i>value</i> are always case sensitive.
</p>
<p>
FHIR defines <a href="terminologies-systems.html">some useful URIs directly</a>. OIDs (urn:oid:) and UUIDs (urn:uuid:) 
may be registered in the <a href="http://hl7.org/oid">HL7 OID registry</a> and should be if the 
content is shared or exchanged across institutional boundaries. If the identifier itself 
is naturally globally unique (e.g. an OID, a UUID, or a URI with no trailing local part), 
then the <i>system</i> SHALL be "urn:ietf:rfc:3986", and the URI is in the <i>value</i>.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, the system may not be known - only the value is known (e.g. a simple device that scans a barcode), 
or the system is known implicitly (simple exchange in a limited context, often driven by barcode readers). 
In this case, no useful matching may be performed using the value unless the system can be safely inferred by the 
context. This practice should be avoided where possible, as 
information sharing in a wider context is very likely to arise eventually, and values without a system are inherently limited in use.
</p>
<p>
The <i>assigner</i> is used to indicate what registry/state/facility/etc. assigned the identifier.

<p>
A name of a human with text, parts and usage information.
</p>
<p>
Names may be changed or repudiated.  People may have different names in different 
contexts. Names may be divided into parts of different type that have variable 
significance depending on context, though the division into parts is not always 
significant. With personal names, the different parts may or may not be imbued with
some implicit meaning; various cultures associate different importance with the 
name parts and the degree to which systems SHALL care about name parts around the 
world varies widely.
</p>
[%dt HumanName%]
<p>
The parts of a name SHOULD NOT contain whitespace. For family name, hyphenated 
names such as "Smith-Jones" are a single name, but names with spaces such as 
"Smith Jones" are broken into multiple parts. For given names, initials may 
be used in place of the full name if that is all that is recorded. 
</p>
<p>
The <i>text</i> element specifies the entire name as it should be represented. This
may be provided instead of or as well as specific parts. Applications updating a name
SHALL ensure either that the text and the parts are in agreement, or that only one
of the two is present. Systems that do not support as many name parts as are 
provided in an instance may wish to append some of the parts together 
using spaces
</p>
<p>
Note that the order of the  parts within a given part type has 
significance and SHALL be observed. The appropriate order between 
family name and given names depends on culture and context of use.

Specifies an event that may occur multiple times. Schedules are not used for recording when things did happen, but when they are expected or requested to occur.
A schedule can be either a list of events - periods on which the event occurs, 
or a single event with repeating criteria, or just repeating criteria with no actual event.

If the schedule has repeating criteria, the repeat can occur a given number of times per 
the specified duration or in relation to some real world event. Also, if the event repeats,
a time to end the schedule can be specified, either with a count of the number of times 
it can occur or a date/time at which to end the schedule. If no end condition is specified, 
the Schedule will terminate on some criteria that are expressed elsewhere.
