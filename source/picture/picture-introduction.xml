<p>The Picture resource is suitable for stills or moving pictures (video).</p>

<p>
While it is clear that there needs to be a resource that handles the exchange in pictures, 
it's not clear whether a resource should be created specifically for this task. In practice,
the Picture resource here is a lot like a profile on an <a href="observation.htm">Observation</a> using
an attachment as a value. In fact, such a <a href="observation-profile-picture.xml.htm">profile is defined</a> for comparison
purposes. The FHIR project team is seeking comments on which makes for easier implementation:
a resource, or a profile on the observation resource (use community input above).
</p>

<p>Alternative question: should this be renamed Media, and include sound recordings? (note what
impact this should have on the properties when making comments on this)</p>
