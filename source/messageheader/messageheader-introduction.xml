<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The MessageHeader resource is defined in order to support <a href="messaging.html">Messaging using FHIR resources</a>.
The principle usage of the MessageHeader resource is when messages are exchanged. However, as a 
resource that can be used with the RESTful framework, the MessageHeader
resource has the normal resource end-point ([base-url]/Message), which is
used to manage a set of static messages resources. This could be used to 
make an archive of past messages available. <b>Creating or updating Message resources
in this fashion does not represent the actual occurrence of any event, nor can it trigger
any logic associated with the actual event.</b> It is just for managing a set of message resources.
