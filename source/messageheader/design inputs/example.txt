What I would have wished for in V2 messaging is a simplification of the FROM and TO addresses.  I don’t believe the “message” resource should be more than “Wrapper” – to be used in the messaging context as a SOAP header would be used in the SOAP context.

My personal preference would be that the “message” would be an envelope, with the typical fields:

Message Resource        V2 equivalence  Cardinality    
<from address>entity</from address>     Replaces MSH.3,4,17,22,24       1.1    
<to address>entity</to address> Replaces MSH.5,6,23,25  1.n    
<priority>??</priority>*        Not in MSH at this time 1.1    
<Security>security_scheme</security>**  Replaces MSH.8  1.1    
<subject>??</subject>   Replaces MSH.9  1.1    
<Message id>id</message id>     Replaces MSH.10 1.1    
<processing-flag>?</processing-flag>    Replaces MSH.11 0.1    
<RSVP>rsvp-type</RSVP>  Replaces MSH.15, 16     1.1    
<profile Identifier>??</profile Identifier>     Replaces MSH.21 1.1    
* Priority would allow me to process “STAT” lab results before “Routine” results.
