<h2>
Notes:
</h2>
<ul>
	<li>There is no persistent identifier on MessageHeader that identifies the specific triggering event for the message - any such identity must be determined from the payload of the message.</li>
 <li>The actual content of the focus resource is specified for each message event (see <a href="messaging.html#events">the list on the messaging page</a>). 
 Any resources referenced in the focus element are always included in the bundle</li>
 <li>If <i>MessageHeader.source.endpoint</i> and <i>MessageHeader.destination.endpoint</i>, are literal URLs, then they SHOULD identify
  the addresses to which messages can be delivered. If they are logical URIs (i.e. non-dereferenceable), 
  message delivery intermediaries must know how to deliver the message to the destination application. </li>
 <li>The time of the event will be found in the focus resource. The time of the message will be found in <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.timestamp">Bundle.timestamp</a></li>
 <li>The sender and receiver are not the actual technical systems - these are the human or organizations that make use of the technical systems</li>
 <li>A receiver is not obligated to reject messages which do not explicitly identify it as receiver (e.g. a tracker will get messages that are destined for some other system)</li>
 <li>The value set MessageEvent is populated by the authors of the resources declaring the events</li>
</ul>
