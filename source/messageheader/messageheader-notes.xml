Notes:
</h2>
<ul>
	<li>There is no persistent identifier on MessageHeader that identifies the specific triggering event for the message - any such identity must be determined from the payload of the message.</li>
 <li>The resources referenced by the enterer, author and responsible elements may 
  all be included in the message bundle or left out on the basis that the recipient (and any intermediaries) are able to locate/resolve the resources
  independently. The former would be suitable for loosely coupled systems, and the latter for tightly coupled systems. The messaging Capability 
  statement for an application may reference a <a href="structuredefinition.html">Structure Definition</a> that describes how the bundling occurs</li>
 <li>The actual content of the focus resource is specified for each message event (see <a href="messaging.html#events">the list on the messaging page</a>). 
 Any resources referenced in the focus element are always included in the bundle</li>
 <li>If <i>MessageHeader.source.endpoint</i> and <i>MessageHeader.destination.endpoint</i>, are literal URLs, then they SHOULD identify
  the addresses to which messages can be delivered. If they are logical URIs (i.e. non-dereferenceable), 
  message delivery intermediaries must know how to deliver the message to the destination application. </li>
 <li>The time of the event will be found in the focus resource. The time of the message will be found in <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.timestamp">Bundle.timestamp</a></li>
 <li>The author and the receiver are not the actual technical systems - these are the human or organizations that make use of the technical systems</li>
 <li>A receiver is not obligated to reject messages which do not explicitly identify it as receiver (e.g. a tracker will get messages that are destined for some other system)</li>
 <li>The value set MessageEvent is populated by the authors of the resources declaring the events</li>
</ul>
