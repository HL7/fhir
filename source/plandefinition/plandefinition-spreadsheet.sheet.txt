For example, two actions that could be in a SentenceGroup are \"aspirin, 500 mg, 2 times per day\" and \"aspirin, 300 mg, 3 times per day\". In both cases, aspirin is the target referenced by the action, and the two actions represent different options for how aspirin might be ordered for the patient. Note that a SentenceGroup would almost always have an associated selection behavior of \"AtMostOne\", unless it\'s a required action, in which case, it would be \"ExactlyOne\"
