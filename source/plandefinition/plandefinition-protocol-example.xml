        <b>name: </b>Measure BMI, 
        <b>description: </b>Measure, Weight, Height, Waist, Circumference; Calculate BMI  Weight must be measured so that the BMI can be calculated. Most charts are based on weights obtained with the patient wearing undergarments and no shoes. BMI can be manually calculated (kg/[height in meters]2), but is more easily obtained from a nomogram. Waist circumference is important because evidence suggests that abdominal fat is a particularly strong determinant of cardiovascular risk in those with a BMI of 25 to 34.9 kg/m2. Increased waist circumference can also be a marker of increased risk even in persons of normal weight. The technique for measuring waist circumference is described in the text. A nutrition assessment will also help to assess the diet and physical activity habits of overweight patients,

        <b>description: </b>The practitioner must seek to determine whether the patient has ever been overweight. While a technical definition is provided, a simple question such as 'Have you ever been overweight?' will accomplish the same goal. Questions directed towards weight history, dietary habits, physical activities, and medications may provide useful information about the origins of obesity in particular patients.,
