Example Scenarios help to make the expected behavior of a collection of systems adhering to a guide more concrete.  It allows the author to say "Imagine you have a patient in situation X and Y needs to happen.  This is what the exchanges between the various imaginary systems might look like for that specific patient."

Creating examples is a lot of work, and creating ExampleScenarios is often an order of magnitude more work, but being able to see the resulting diagrams of flows and click through to see the specific instances that are being exchanged can be extremely helpful in solidifying implementer understanding of the 'workflow' implied by an implementation guide.

In addition to the examples provided in the examples tab, you can also see some useful examples of ExampleScenario in the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/physical-activity/STU1/artifacts.html#7">Physical Activity implementation guide</a>.
