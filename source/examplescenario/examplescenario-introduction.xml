<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
ExampleScenario provides examples for how certain data exchange workflows might manifest.  This resource is similar to <a href="implementationguide.html">ImplementationGuide</a>, <a href="requirements.html">Requirements</a>, <a href="actordefinition.html">ActorDefinition</a>, and other resources that will typically only be exchanged as part of implementation 
guide packages and will be used by implementers to understand how to design systems rather than being used to share information between clinical systems.
</p>
<p>
This resource can be used to show how instances would evolve over time as well as the interplay of systems over time to accomplish a particular end-state.  It
will frequently be used to generate sequence diagrams, but also provides further information about all of the entities within the sequence diagrams,
including the instances shared as part of the exchange.
</p>
<p>
This resource is most useful when documenting more complex flows rather than simple RESTful invocations or other request-response pairs.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
<a href="plandefinition.html">PlanDefinitions</a> also describe actors and sequences of interactions between them, including alternatives.  
However, PlanDefinition defines what's allowed, while ExampleScenario represents a potential pathway through what's allowed.  While an ExampleScenario
can define alternatives, it doesn't necessarily call out all of them.  Instead, it highlights the path(s) of interest to help a reader understand what's possible
or how a particular scenario might work.

Any resource can be an 'example' in a specification.  This resource is specifically about highlighting how those examples come together in a workflow - 
who exchanges them and under what circumstances.
