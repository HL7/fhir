<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
This resource is expected to be used in implementation guides or other specifications to provide examples for how certain workflows would manifest.
It can be used to show how instances would evolve over time as well as the interplay of systems over time to accomplish a particular end-state.  It
will frequently be used to generate sequence diagrams, but also provides further information about all of the entities within the sequence diagrams,
including the instances shared as part of the exchange.
</p>
<p>
This resource is most useful when documenting more complex flows rather than simple RESTful invocations or other request-response pairs.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
<a href="plandefinition.html">PlanDefinitions</a> also describe actors and sequences of interactions between them, including alternatives.  
However, PlanDefinition defines what's allowed, while ExampleScenario represents a potential pathway through what's allowed.  While an ExampleScenario
can define alternatives, it doesn't call out all of them.  Instead, it highlights the path(s) of interest to help a reader understand what's possible
or how a particular scenario might work.

Any resource can be an 'example' in a specification.  This resource is specifically about highlighting how those examples come together in a workflow - 
who exchanges them and under what circumstances.
