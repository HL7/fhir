<p>
The FHIR specification describes a set of <a href="resource.html">resources</a>,
and several different frameworks for exchanging resources between different systems.
Because of its general nature and wide applicability, the rules made in this
specification are fairly loose. As a consequence, and in order to insure
interoperability between applications claiming conformance to this specification, a
testing framework has been established within the FHIR specification. To this end, the
<a href="testscript.html">TestScript</a> resource provides an implementation-agnostic
description of tests that allows test execution engines to evaluate if a FHIR
implementation conforms with the FHIR specification. Providing a clear and concise
test methodology for the FHIR specification through the TestScript resource helps to
enable interoperability among various FHIR server and client implementations.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the TestScript resource provides clear examples of the appropriate use
of the FHIR specification through test-based documentation. The TestScript resource
stands as a form of executable documentation allowing developers to examine the
operations defined by the tests in order to understand how various RESTful API
interactions and resources should be used in coordination. The tests can also be
automatically executed against systems under development to determine how well the
systems adhere to the specification.

<h3>Execution</h3>
<a name="workflow"></a>
<h4 id="workflow">Workflow</h4>
<p><b>Pre-Processing</b></p>
<p>
  The TestScript execution workflow begins by determining if the test suite is appropriate for the server under test. This can be determined by evaluating if the interactions listed in the TestScript metadata "capabilities" section are supported by the server's conformance resource. If the capabilities are supported by the server, then the TestScript can be executed. Otherwise, a test engine will provide a comparison of the system under test�s conformance capabilities and allow a TestScript as a whole to be skipped based on this comparison. See <a href="#howToSpecifiyCapabilities">How to specify metadata capabilities</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If the server supports the requirements of the TestScript instance, any specified fixtures are loaded or retrieved. If the fixtures are marked as 'autocreate' then they are automatically created on the server(s) under test using 'create' operations. If any of the autocreate operations fail, then the tests in the TestScript are skipped.
</p>
<p><b>Setup Execution</b></p>
<p>
  After the fixtures are loaded and autocreates are executed, the setup section is executed to establish the testing environment. The purpose of the setup section is typically to pre-load data (if it was not autocreated) or delete data required for the execution of the tests against the FHIR system(s) under test. The setup operations are executed once before all the tests are run (see <a href="#operation-execution">Operation Execution</a>). All operations in a setup section (including assertions) must complete successfully for the subsequent tests to be executed. If an assertion operation in the setup section fails, then execution and evaluation of the tests in the TestScript should be skipped. Technically, any operation (see the <a href="#operations-table">operations table</a> for a complete listing) can be included in the setup section, but typical operations will be create, update, read, and vread.
</p>
<p>
  Due to the possibility that the setup actions are not required on the server under test, the TestScript execution workflow MAY provide the capability of skipping or ignoring the setup section of the TestScript.
</p>
<p><b>Test Execution</b></p>
<p>
  Once setup is complete, each test is executed. Tests contain a set of operations, and executing a test involves the evaluation of each operation listed in the test in the order defined by the test (see <a href="#operation-execution">Operation Execution</a> and the <a href="#operations-table">list of operations</a>).
</p>
<p><b>Teardown Execution</b></p>
<p>
  After all the tests have completed execution, the teardown section is executed. The purpose of the teardown section is to revert the FHIR server under test to a pre-test clean state. This requires removing any resources or artifacts generated as part of test suite setup or test execution. Technically, any operation (see the <a href="#operations-table">operations table</a> for a complete listing) can be included in the teardown section, but the most often used operation will be delete. Assertions are not supported in the teardown section.
</p>
<p>
  Due to the possibility that the teardown actions are not required on the server under test, the TestScript execution workflow MAY provide the capability of skipping or ignoring the teardown section of the TestScript.
</p>
<p><b>Post-Processing</b></p>
<p>
  After the teardown section is executed, any fixtures that were marked 'autodelete' are removed from the server(s) under test. After this final stage, the execution of the TestScript is complete.
</p>

<a name="fixtures"></a>
<h4 id="fixtures">Fixtures</h4>
<p>
  The fixtures section of the TestScript defines a set of resource instances that will be used as part of the setup, test, and teardown sections during TestScript execution. All defined fixtures are expected to be required in order for the test script to execute. Each fixture defines a resource instance by URI, and must be identified by an ID. The URI can be local or remote (i.e. another server than the one the TestScript resource resides), absolute or relative. The ID on the fixture is considered the "source" identifier of the fixture -- it is not the same thing as the resource ID on the server where it was hosted. The "source" identifier is used to define the fixture instance within the context of the TestScript. Operations reference the ID of a fixture to uniquely identify the fixture instance the operation is using ("sourceId") or acting against ("targetId"). Once a fixture has been instantiated on a server (typically by the use of a create operation), the fixture ID is mapped to the ID of the corresponding resource instance on the server. TestScript execution engines must maintain this relationship between fixture IDs and server resource IDs. The TestScript execution engine is responsible for translating the fixture IDs (whether provided to the operation as "source" or "target") to the ID of the resource on the server during execution.
</p>
<p>
  Using the optional "autocreate" and "autodelete" elements (missing values default to false), fixtures can be configured to automatically be created during TestScript setup and automatically deleted during TestScript teardown. This means that additional "create" and "delete" operations in the TestScript.setup and TestScript.teardown sections are unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="profiles"></a>
<h4 id="profiles">Profiles</h4>
<p>
  The profiles section of the TestScript defines a set of FHIR profiles (see <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a> resource) that will be used as part of the setup or test sections during TestScript execution. Each profile defines a StructureDefinition instance by URI, and must be identified by an ID. The URI SHALL reference a known FHIR profile corresponding to the FHIR specification version being tested. As with Fixtures, the ID on the profile is considered the "source" identifier of the profile. Operations reference the ID of a profile to uniquely identify the profile instance the operation is using ("validateProfileId").
</p>
<p>
  See <a href="#howToUseProfiles">Use Profiles</a> for more information.
</p>

<a name="variables"></a>
<h4 id="variables">Variables</h4>
<p>
  The variables section of the TestScript defines a set of expressions whose evaluations will be used in substitutions. These substitutions are performed in operation request headers and URL paths as well as assertion values.
</p>
<p>
  Without variables, search parameters and request headers (such as If-Modified-Since) would be specified in outgoing requests as literal values. Variables allow the values to be managed externally in fixtures or dynamically in server response fixtures. They would be defined to hold path expressions against the fixtures. The path expressions would not change from one server to another, but the fixture data could.
</p>
<p>
  Using variables allows for the same test scripts to be executed against the same servers by different clients at the same time. Each client would change the fixture data (external to the test script) to make the data unique to that client. This ensures that the same delete/create/read operations executed concurrently by one client does not interfere with those of another client. That can be important within the context of a testing event such as a Connectathon. It can be very useful in year-round testing against public servers as well.
</p>
<p>
  See <a href="#howToUseVariables">Use Variables</a> for more information.
</p>

<a name="op"></a>
<h4 id="operation-execution">Operation Execution</h4>
<p>
  The setup, test, and teardown sections of a TestScript can contain operation elements. Operations are intended to be executed in sequence and they represent the logic defined by the TestScript. Operations define a type, sourceId, targetId, destination, responseId, contentType, and other parameters. The type of the operation aligns with a corresponding RESTful API interaction. The sourceId and targetId of an operation define the context of the fixture data the operation is acting against (see <a href="#fixtures">Fixtures</a>). The destination defines the server the operation is executed on and is only required for tests that include multiple servers. The responseId specifies a fixture ID to use to map to the server response. The contentType defines the format (XML or JSON) and the corresponding mime-type (application/fhir+xml and application/fhir+json) to use in the RESTful operation (defaulting to XML). The parameters of an operation allow providing additional data required for execution.
</p>
<p>
  TestScript execution engines must load the operation details and execute the operation against the server(s) under test. Operations that are expected to result in an error or exception shall immediately be followed by one or more "assertion" operations (that test for those error conditions), otherwise the test fails. This allows for "negative" testing (for example, the test script may perform operations that should return a 4XX or 5XX HTTP response code). Test execution is halted as soon as an operation or assertion fails. If an operation or assertion fails, then the test ends in failure and the test script execution proceeds to the next test. Once all tests have completed execution, the teardown section is executed. Once teardown completes, the suite execution is complete. If any setup or test operation or assertion failed, the test script is marked in failure. Failures in teardown are ignored.
</p>

<a name="assert"></a>
<h4 id="assertion-execution">Assertion Execution</h4>
<p>
The "assertion" evaluates the results of previous operations to determine if the server under test behaves appropriately. In order to evaluate an assertion, the request, response, and results of the most recently executed operation must always be maintained by the TestScript execution engine.
</p>
<p>
  The TestScript execution engine must implement the behavior of each assertion to determine if the response of the last operation meets the conditions of the assertion.
</p>
<p>
  If the conditions of the assertion are met execution of the test continues. If the conditions of the assertion are not met, the test being executed fails and execution of the test is halted. Test execution will then continue with the next test.
</p>
<p><b>Conditional Asserts</b></p>
<p>
  The ability to conditionally evaluate an assert is not defined as part of the native behavior within the TestScript resource or execution engine. This means that all subsequent test asserts are not evaluated when a prior assert within the same test evaluates to a failure. The current workaround is to set warningOnly=true for those asserts that require conditional evaluation.
</p>
<p>
  Another optional workaround is to provide the TestScript execution engine with access to an external Rules engine. The TestScript execution engine author is encouraged to build and publish this functionality within an appropriate FHIR <a href="implementationguide.html">ImplementationGuide</a>.

<h3>How Tos</h3>
<a name="mark"></a>
<h4 id="markAsText">Mark a Resource as a Test</h4>
<p>
To mark a resource as a test resource, use the testing tag:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;Patient xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir"&gt;
  &lt;meta&gt;
    &lt;security&gt;
      &lt;system value="http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActReason"/&gt;
      &lt;code value="HTEST"/&gt;
      &lt;display value="test health data"/&gt;
    &lt;/security&gt;
  &lt;/meta&gt;
&lt;/Patient&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Not all testing resources need to explicitly marked as 'HTEST', but it
may be necessary when performing testing on a production system, for
instance. Note: This is a security label because different access control rules may apply to test resources.
</p>


<a name="create"></a>
<h4 id="howToTestCreate">Test create operation</h4>
<p>To test if the <a href="http.html#create">create</a> operation is properly supported on a server, run the operation as part of <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.test">TestScript.test</a>.</p>
<p>First, define the <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.fixture">fixture</a> as a <a href="references.html">reference</a> at the top of the test script. The fixture will hold the body of the POST request:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<fixture id="example-patient">
  <resource>
    <reference value="Patient/patient-example.xml"/>
  </resource>
</fixture>
</xmp></div>
<p>Note that it is illegal for the fixture to contain a resource id in a create operation.</p>
<p>Point the <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.operation.sourceId">sourceId</a> element of the create operation to the fixture id just defined:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <operation>
    <type>
      <system value="http://hl7.org/fhir/testscript-operation-codes"/>
      <code value="create"/>
    </type>
    <sourceId value="example-patient"/>
  </operation>
</action>
</xmp></div>

<p>There are two ways to verify that the create operation returned the right status code:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.assert.response">assert.response</a>:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <assert>
    <response value="created" />
  </assert>
</action>
</xmp></div>
See <a href="valueset-assert-response-code-types.html">response codes</a> for complete list.
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.assert.responseCode">assert.responseCode</a> explicitly:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <assert>
    <responseCode value="201" />
  </assert>
</action>
</xmp></div>
</li>
</ol>

<hr/><!-- =========================================================================================================================================================== -->
<a name="search"></a>
<h4 id="howToTestSearch">Test search operation</h4>
<p>To test if <a href="http.html#search">search</a> operation is properly supported on a server, run the operation as part of <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.test">TestScript.test</a>.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.operation.resource">resource</a> element to specify the resource type and the <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.operation.params">params</a> element to specify the search parameters:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <operation>
    <type>
      <system value="http://hl7.org/fhir/testscript-operation-codes"/>
      <code value="search"/>
    </type>
    <resource value="Patient" />
    <contentType value="json" />
    <params value="?given=John&amp;family=Doe" />
    <responseId value="R1" />
  </operation>
</action>
</xmp></div>
<p>The <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.operation.contentType">contentType</a> element is optional and will default to "xml" which will translate to HTTP request header "Content-Type" being set to "application/fhir+xml" by test engines. In this case, though, it was used to set it to "application/fhir+json".</p>
<p>The <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.operation.responseId">responseId</a> element was used to store the response in a reference called "R1". This reference will hold both the response headers and the response body.</p>
<p>Verify that the search operation returned the right status code:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <assert>
    <response value="okay" />
  </assert>
</action>
</xmp></div>
<p>See <a href="valueset-assert-response-code-types.html">response codes</a> for complete list.</p>

<p>Verify that the search operation returned the right resource type:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <assert>
    <resource value="Patient" />
  </assert>
</action>
</xmp></div>

<p>There are many ways to verify that the search operation returned the right Patient:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Explicitly compare the elements to known value:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <assert>
    <path value="fhir:Patient/fhir:birthDate/@value"/>
    <sourceId value="R1"/>
    <value value="1974-12-31" />
  </assert>
</action>
</xmp></div>
<p>The <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.assert.sourceId">sourceId</a> element is pointed to the <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.operation.responseId">responseId</a> value of the search operation. If no <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.assert.sourceId">sourceId</a> is specified, then test engines will use the response of the last operation in the test script even if <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.operation.responseId">responseId</a> was not specified in the operation.</p>
<p>The <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.assert.path">path</a> element holds a FHIRPath expression against the response body contents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the elements in response to elements in another fixture that is either dynamically set by <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.operation.responseId">responseId</a> or defined statically by the <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.fixture">fixture</a> element at the top of the script:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <assert>
    <compareToSourceId value="F1"/>
    <compareToSourcePath value="fhir:Patient/fhir:birthDate/@value"/>
    <path value="fhir:Patient/fhir:birthDate/@value"/>
  </assert>
</action>
</xmp></div>
<p>This time the birthDate value in the response is compared to the birthDate value in a fixture called 'F1'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify that the response contains all the element/content in another fixture pointed to by <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.assert.minimumId">minimumId</a>.</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <assert>
  	<minimumId value="F1"/>
    <sourceId value="R1"/>
  </assert>
</action>
</xmp></div>
<p>Test engines will parse the 'body' of the F1 fixture and verify that each element and its value matches the corresponding element in the R1 response body. In other words, R1 is verified to be a 'superset' of F1. The resource id element in the body will be ignored during comparison. The headers will also be ignored.</p>
<p>F1 can be statically defined or it can be the <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.operation.responseId">responseId</a> for another operation. If <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.assert.sourceId">sourceId</a> is not specified, then test engines will use the response of the last operation. So the previous assertion could have been defined as:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <assert>
    <minimumId value="F1"/>
  </assert>
</action>
</xmp></div>

</li>
</ol>

<a name="delete"></a>
<h4 id="howToDeleteResourceInTeardown">Perform delete operation in teardown</h4>
<p>Test scripts should clean up resources created as part of execution. The <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.teardown">TestScript.teardown</a> operations will get executed once before the test script execution completes.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of ways to run delete operation in <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.teardown">TestScript.teardown</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <a href="http.html#2.1.0.12.1">conditional delete</a> operation in <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.teardown">TestScript.teardown</a>:
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>

    <params value="?given=John&amp;family=Doe" />
  </operation>
</action>
</xmp></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use delete operation with targetId fixture.</p>
<p>To do that, the resource must have been created during <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup">TestScript.setup</a> or <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.test">TestScript.test</a>:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>

      <code value="delete"/>
    </type>
    <targetId value="create-response"/>
  </operation>
</action>
</xmp></div>
<p>Test engines will keep track of response headers and body of all operations.</p>
<p>The delete operation's targetId value is expected to correspond to the responseId of a GET operation (such as search or read) or the sourceId of a POST/PUT operation (such as create).</p>
<p>For targetId value corresponding to responseId of GET operations (such as search or read), test engines will use the resource type and id returned in the GET response body's resource to set the [type] and [id] in delete operation's URL, respectively.</p>
<p>For targetId value corresponding to responseId of POST/PUT operations (such as create), test engines will use the resource type and id returned in the POST/PUT response "Location" header to set the [type] and [id] in delete operation's URL, respectively. This is the case in the example above.</p>
<p>The targetId value cannot point to a statically defined fixture as the id in the fixture cannot be relied upon.</p>

<a name="update"></a>
<h4 id="howToTestUpdateOperation">Test update operation</h4>
<p><a href="http.html#update">Update</a> operations require a resource id. The id must be present in the fixture (PUT body contents) as well as the URL. The values must match.</p>

<p>Because resource ids cannot be predicted on the server, it is best to retrieve the id on a resource freshly created as part of the script</p>

<p>There are many ways to do that. Below is a couple:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use update operation with <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.operation.targetId">targetId</a> fixture pointing to create operation's <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.operation.responseId">responseId</a>:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <operation>
    <type>
      <system value="http://hl7.org/fhir/testscript-operation-codes"/>
      <code value="create"/>

    <responseId value="create-response" />
    <sourceId value="example-patient"/>
  </operation>
</action>
</xmp></div>

<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <operation>
    <type>
      <system value="http://hl7.org/fhir/testscript-operation-codes"/>
      <code value="update"/>
    </type>
    <resource value="Patient"/>
    <responseId value="R3" />
    <sourceId value="john-doe-update"/>
    <targetId value="create-response"/>
  </operation>
</action>
</xmp></div>
<p>Test engines will keep track of response headers and body of all operations.</p>
<p>The update operation's targetId value is expected to correspond to the responseId of a GET operation (such as search or read) or the sourceId of a POST/PUT operation (such as create).</p>
<p>For targetId value corresponding to responseId of GET operations (such as search or read), test engines will use the resource type and id returned in the GET response body's resource to set the [type] and [id] in update operation's URL, respectively. This is the case in the next example below.</p>
<p>For targetId value corresponding to responseId of POST/PUT operations (such as create and update), test engines will use the resource type and id returned in the POST/PUT response "Location" header to set the [type] and [id] in update operation's URL, respectively. This is the case in the example above.</p>
<p>The targetId value cannot point to a statically defined fixture as the id in the fixture cannot be relied upon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use update operation with <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.operation.targetId">targetId</a> fixture pointing to search operation's <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.setup.action.operation.responseId">responseId</a>:</p>

  </operation>
</action>
</xmp></div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>After the update operation, test scripts would perform at least one more read/search operation to retrieve the contents of the updated resource and then perform assertions to verify that the data did indeed get updated on the server:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>

    <params value="?family=Doe&amp;given=Joe"/>
    <responseId value="R4" />
  </operation>
</action>

<p>Verify that the birthdate got updated and is being returned properly:</p>

</xmp></div>

<p>Test engines will not evaluate this at this point. They will store the expression in "V1" and will look for "${}" in "operation.params", "operation.requestHeader.value", and "operation.url" element values during operation calls. </p>

<p>Here is a read operation that will use the V1 variable. The variable expression was "Location against R1 response" (defined above). If a prior operation has not set R1 to be the responseId of the operation, then test engine will error out. Otherwise, V1 will be set to the Location header value of R1 response and that value will be substituted for ${V1} below. In other words, the read will be performed against the Location header value of R1 response.</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <operation>
    <type>
      <system value="http://hl7.org/fhir/testscript-operation-codes"/>
      <code value="read"/>
    </type>
    <accept value="json" />
    <responseId value="R2" />
    <url value="${V1}" />
  </operation>
</action>
</xmp></div>

<p>Below are three variables defined as path expressions against the static fixture referenced by "F1". The expressions are against the given name, family name, and birthDate of a patient resource. The resource data will be managed external to the test script.</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<variable>
  <name value="PatientGivenName" />
  <path value="fhir:Patient/fhir:name/fhir:given/@value" />
  <sourceId value="F1" />
</variable>
<variable>
  <name value="PatientFamilyName" />
  <path value="fhir:Patient/fhir:name/fhir:family/@value" />
  <sourceId value="F1" />
</variable>
<variable>
  <name value="PatientDOB" />
  <path value="hir:Patient/fhir:birthDate/@value" />
  <sourceId value="F1" />
</variable>
</xmp></div>

<p>Again, test engines will not evaluate the path expression at this point. They will look for anything wrapped in '${}' in "operation.params", "operation.requestHeader.value", "operation.url", and "assert.value" element values and substitute the placeholders with the evaluated expressions.</p>

<p>Here is a conditional create operation that will set the requestHeader using the PatientGivenName, PatientFamilyName, and PatientDOB variables defined above. The variable expressions were path expressions against the statically defined F1 fixture. They will be evaluated against the fixture body (containing resource) and the corresponding values will be extracted from the fixtures and used to substitute the variables in the requestHeader value below.</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <operation>
    <type>
      <system value="http://hl7.org/fhir/testscript-operation-codes"/>
      <code value="create"/>
    </type>
    <requestHeader>
      <field value="If-None-Exist" />
      <value value="Patient?given=${PatientGivenName}&amp;${PatientFamilyName}&amp;birthdate=${PatientDOB}" />
    </requestHeader>
    <sourceId value="F1" />
  </operation>
</action>
</xmp></div>

<p>Here is a search operation that will perform a search using the PatientGivenName, PatientFamilyName, and PatientDOB variables defined above. The variable expressions were path expressions against the statically defined F1 fixture. They will be evaluated against the fixture body (containing resource) and the corresponding values will be extracted from the fixtures and used to substitute the variables in the params value below.</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<action>
  <operation>
    <type>
      <system value="http://hl7.org/fhir/testscript-operation-codes"/>

  </operation>
</action>

<p>Here are the assertions that verify that the search was successful:</p>

<a name="metadata"></a>
<h4 id="howToSpecifiyCapabilities">How to specify metadata capabilities</h4>
<p>If the capabilities are supported by the server, then the TestScript can be executed. Otherwise, a test engine will provide a comparison of the system under test�s conformance capabilities and allow a TestScript as a whole to be skipped based on this comparison..</p>
<p>Here's how to specify that the test script requires the server to support Patient create and delete operations:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<metadata>
  <capabilities>
    <required value="true"/>
    <description value="Patient Create and Delete Operation"/>
    <link value="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/FHIR-Develop/http.html#create"/>
    <link value="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/FHIR-Develop/http.html#delete"/>
    <conformance>
      <reference value="/Conformance/PatientCreateDelete.xml" />
    </conformance>
  </capabilities>
</metadata>
</xmp></div>

<p>The contents of PatientCreateDelete.xml would be a minimal capability statement to indicate what sections need to be present in server capability statement:</p>
<div class="xmlCode"><xmp>
<Conformance xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir">
  <rest>
    <mode value="server"/>
    <resource>
      <type value="Patient"/>
      <interaction>
        <code value="create"/>
      </interaction>
      <interaction>
        <code value="delete"/>
      </interaction>
    </resource>
  </rest>
</Conformance>
</xmp></div>

<p>When the metadata capabilities section is defined at <a href="testscript-definitions.html#TestScript.metadata">TestScript.metadata</a> and the server's capability statement does not contain the elements defined in the minimal capability statement, then all the tests in the TestScript are skipped.</p>

<p>The "metadata.capabilities.required" and "metadata.capabilities.validated" elements only indicate whether the capabilities are the primary focus of the test script or not. The do not impact the skipping logic. Capabilities whose "metadata.capabilities.validated" flag is true are the primary focus of the test script.</p>
