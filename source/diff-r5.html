<p>
  This page has only partially been updated for R6 at this time; this will be addressed prior to the next
  ballot. None of the content here is worth commenting on for ballot purposes (as content is likely to change before the next ballot).

<p>
This is an automatically generated list of all the structural differences between
FHIR R5 and R6. The following possible changes are checked when 
preparing this list (and others throughout the specification):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Addition or deletion of elements, or name change to elements</li>
  <li>Changes to minimum and maximum cardinality</li>
  <li>Changes to allowed types</li>
  <li>Changes to bindings for Extensible/Required bindings, and changes to codes if it's a required binding on a code element</li>
  <li>Changes to the is-modifier status of an element</li>
  <li>Changes to the default value for an element (default values were removed after Release 4, but changes are noted for Release 4 to Release 5)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This analysis only considers changes to datatypes and resources. Comparison of profiles and value sets will be 
added in a future version. 
</p>
