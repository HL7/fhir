<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
 <li>The document information is whatever information can be extracted from the binary document. The definition is shared between this resource and the <a href="document.html">document resource</a></li>
 <li>The document information doesn't change once created - only the entry content, such as subject and availability, is updated</li>
 <li>In XDS, a full information.versionId is required</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Open Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Should this indexing function be limited to documents, or is there value in being able to index other types of records?</li>
</ul>
