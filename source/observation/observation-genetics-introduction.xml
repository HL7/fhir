<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
Observation-genetics-profile extends <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> resource to enable reporting of structured genetic test results. In addition, the genetics profile contextualizes well established standards from the field of clinical genetics into the standards of healthcare (e.g. HGNC - HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee's international standard for gene names, symbols, and identifiers).
</p>
<p>
For use cases, details on how this resource interact with other Clinical Genomics resources or profiles, please refer to implementation guidance document <a href="genomics.html">here </a>.
</p>

<h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
<p>
The Observation-genetics profile supports reporting of a DNA variant at the genomic, cDNA, and protein change level. In addition, a condition context may be provided, as AssessedCondition. For large genomic tests, a condition may be used as an input into the analytic pipeline to aid in the identification of clinically relevant variants related to the test order. It is strongly encouraged to provide all available information in this profile for any reported variants, because receiving systems (e.g. discovery research, outcomes analysis, and public health reporting) may use this information to normalize variants over time or across sources.  However, these data should not be used to dynamically correct/change variant representations for clinical use outside of the laboratory, due to insufficient information.

</p>
<p>
Implementers should be aware that semantic equivalency of results of genetic variants cannot be guaranteed unless there is an agreed upon standard between sending and receiving systems.
</p>
<p>
This FHIR genomics work is based on work of the HL7 Clinical Genomics Workgroup and modeled based on the Domain Analysis Model and SMART on FHIR Genomics as published in JAMIA 2015 (http://jamia.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/21/jamia.ocv045.long).
</p>
<p>
The HL7 Clinical Genomics Work Group emphasizes the importance of transmitting structured genetic findings within the clinical, translational, and research environments fully integrated with other clinical data, in order to drive outcomes analysis, operational decision making, discovery research, and public health reporting. The standard doesn't currently cover the reporting of clinically relevant negative or wild type results within genetic data portion of the message.

<h3>Interpretation</h3>

<p>Extension - geneticsInterpretation points to an Observation entity. In this Observation entity, Observation.component is used for recording clinical interpretations for variation.  </p>
<p>Here is a LOINC panel that could be supported by Observation.component:</p>
