<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
This profile sets expectations for use of the <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> resource to record Vital Signs of a patient within the <a href="daf.html">Data Access Framework (DAF)</a> Implementation Guide. This profile identifies which core elements,extensions,vocabularies and value sets must be <i>Supported</i> by DAF actors.
For the definition of <i>Supported</i> please refer to <a href="daf.html">DAF FHIR IG</a>. The data elements identified by the profile are based on ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC and DAF use cases. 
The mappings between the ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC data elements and DAF data elements are captured in the table below, where the first column identifies the ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC data element name, 
the second column maps the ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC data elements to DAF data elements which are derived from ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC standards and DAF use cases and lastly the third column identifies the mapping to FHIR resources and attributes.

<h2>Meaningful Use Data Element Mapping</h2>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
This profile relies on the following other profiles:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="patient-daf.html">DAFPatient</a> which defines DAF Patient profile is used by DAFVitalSigns profile to refer to patients.</li>
  <li><a href="encounter-daf.html">DAFEncounter</a> which defines DAF Encounter profile is used by DAFVitalSigns profile to refer to encounters during which the vital signs measurements were captured.</li>
  <li><a href="extensibility.html">FHIR Extensibility</a> defines how extensions can be applied to FHIR resources and data types. 
  Specifically the <a href="extension-data-absent-reason.html">data-absent-reason</a> extension can be used to code data elements with missing information when appropriate.
  See <a href="daf.html">DAF FHIR IG</a> for additional guidance.</li>
