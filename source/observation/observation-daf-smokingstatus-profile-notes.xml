<h2>Example Usage Scenarios</h2>

<p>
The following are example usage scenarios for the DAF Smoking Status profile:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Query for Smoking Status of a particular patient</li>
	<li>Query for all patients who have had a history of smoking</li>
	<li>Query for all patients who have never had tobacco</li>
	<li>Query for all patients who have smoked during a time period of interest</li>
	<li>Query for all patients who have a smoking history and are in an age group</li>
</ul>

<h2>Profile specific implementation guidance</h2>

<p>
Implementers need to be mindful of the following during their implementation
</p>
<ul>
	<p><b>Smoking Status Applicability:</b> The Smoking Status values describe point-in-time smoking status, and implementers have to be mindful of the semantic meaning while using these codes to describe smoking behavior. For example, if I want to say that a patient used to smoke heavily between 2000 and 2010, it <u>does not</u> make sense to use the code for Former smoker', along with an appliesPeriod representing 2000-2010. This is because 'Former smoker' <u>did not</u> apply during that time range. Instead implementers should use a 'current smoker' along with a time range representing 2000-2010. </p>
