<h2>Notes:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    The element that contains the actual value of the result has a variable name 
	depending on the type. The name is "value" + the type name, ignoring parameters, 
	with a capital on the first letter, e.g. valueInterval or valueString
  </li>
  <li>
    The obtainedDateTime or obtainedPeriod is the time that the observation is most 
    relevant as an observation of the subject. For a biological subject (e.g. a human patient), 
    this is the physiologically relevant time of the observation. 
	In the case of an observation on a specimen, this represents the start and 
    end of the specimen collection (which may include multiple specimens). 
    In the case of an observation obtained directly from a subject (e.g., BP, 
    Chest X-ray), this represent the start and end time of the observation process.
  </li>
  <li>
    At its simplest, resource instances can consist of only a type and a value, with a reliability and status flag.  
    The relevance of other properties will vary based on the type of observation.  
	Normal range may be useful for lab tests and other measures like systolic blood pressure, but will have little 
	relevance for something like "pregnancy status"
  </li>
  <li>
    Profiles will be created to provide guidance on capturing certain types 
    of simple observations.  This resource focuses on the level of detail
    captured by most systems.  However, any "simple" observation can easily 
	be broken into numerous components and sub-components to provide additional
    information relevant in certain circumstances.  As with other resources, 
	extensions can be used to introduce this additional complexity.

 <li>
   Although the search parameter value is labelled as a token, it can be used 
   to search against multiple different parameter types:
   <table class="grid">
    <tr> <td>CodeableConcept</td> <td>Use normal token based matching</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>string</td> <td>Interpreted as a code with no system namespace</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>Quantity</td> <td>If the value of the parameter is a number (potentially with &lt; etc), it is a search on the value (todo: units, canonical?)</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>Attachment</td> <td>Not included in search results</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>Ratio</td> <td>Not included in search results</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>Period</td> <td>Not included in search results</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>SampledData</td> <td>Not included in search results</td> </tr>
   </table>
 </li>
</ul>
