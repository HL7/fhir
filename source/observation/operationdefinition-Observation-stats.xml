  <description value="The Statistics operation performs a set of statistical calculations on a set of clinical measurements such as a blood pressure as stored on the server.  This operation evaluates [Observation](observation.html) resources having valueQuantity elements that have UCUM unit codes. Observations with a status of 'entered-in-error' will be excluded from the calculations.  &#xD;&#xD;The set of Observations is defined by 4 parameters:&#xD;&#xD;*  the subject of the observations for which the statistics are being generated (`subject`)&#xD;* which observations to generate statistics for (`code` and `system`, or `coding`)&#xD;* the time period over which to generate statistics 'duration` or `period`)&#xD;* the set of statistical analyses to return (`statistic`)&#xD;&#xD;Possible statistical analyses (see [StatisticsCode](valueset-observation-statistics.html)):&#xD;&#xD; - **average** (&#34;Average&#34;): The [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) of N measurements over the stated period.&#xD;&#xA; - **maximum** (&#34;Maximum&#34;): The [maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_element) value of N measurements over the stated period.&#xD;&#xA; - **minimum** (&#34;Minimum&#34;): The [minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_element) value of N measurements over the stated period.&#xD;&#xA; - **count** (&#34;Count&#34;): The [number] of valid measurements over the stated period that contributed to the other statistical outputs.&#xD;&#xA; - **total-count** (&#34;Total Count&#34;): The total [number] of valid measurements over the stated period, including observations that were ignored because they did not contain valid result values.&#xD;&#xA; - **median** (&#34;Median&#34;): The [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) of N measurements over the stated period.&#xD;&#xA; - **std-dev** (&#34;Standard Deviation&#34;): The [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of N measurements over the stated period.&#xD;&#xA; - **sum** (&#34;Sum&#34;): The [sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation) of N measurements over the stated period.&#xD;&#xA; - **variance** (&#34;Variance&#34;): The [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) of N measurements over the stated period.&#xD;&#xA; - **20-percent** (&#34;20th Percentile&#34;): The 20th [Percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) of N measurements over the stated period.&#xD;&#xA; - **80-percent** (&#34;80th Percentile&#34;): The 80th [Percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) of N measurements over the stated period.&#xD;&#xA; - **4-lower** (&#34;Lower Quartile&#34;): The lower [Quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) Boundary of N measurements over the stated period.&#xD;&#xA; - **4-upper** (&#34;Upper Quartile&#34;): The upper [Quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) Boundary of N measurements over the stated period.&#xD;&#xA; - **4-dev** (&#34;Quartile Deviation&#34;): The difference between the upper and lower [Quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) is called the Interquartile range. (IQR = Q3-Q1) Quartile deviation or Semi-interquartile range is one-half the difference between the first and the third quartiles.&#xD;&#xA; - **5-1** (&#34;1st Quintile&#34;): The lowest of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.&#xD;&#xA; - **5-2** (&#34;2nd Quintile&#34;): The second of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.&#xD;&#xA; - **5-3** (&#34;3rd Quintile&#34;): The third of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.&#xD;&#xA; - **5-4** (&#34;4th Quintile&#34;): The fourth of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.&#xD;&#xA; - **skew** (&#34;Skew&#34;): Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive or negative, or even undefined.  Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness).&#xD;&#xA; - **kurtosis** (&#34;Kurtosis&#34;): Kurtosis  is a measure of the &#34;tailedness&#34; of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable.   Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis).&#xD;&#xA; - **regression** (&#34;Regression&#34;): Linear regression is an approach for modeling two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variables. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression)  This Statistic code will return both a gradient and an intercept value.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xD;If successful, the operation returns an Observation resource for each code with the results of the statistical calculations as component value pairs where the component code = the statistical code. The Observation also contains the input parameters `patient`,`code` and `duration` parameters. If unsuccessful, an [OperationOutcome](operationoutcome.html) with an error message will be returned.&#xD;&#xD;The client can request that all the observations on which the statistics are based be returned as well, using the include parameter. If an include parameter is specified, a limit may also be specified; the sources observations are subsetted at the server's discretion if count &gt; limit. This functionality is included with the intent of supporting graphical presentation"/>
