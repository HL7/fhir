    <h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
    <p>This resource is an <a href="workflow.html#event">
        <em>event resource</em>
      </a> from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a>.</p>
    <p>Observations are a central element in healthcare, used to support diagnosis, monitor progress, determine baselines and patterns and even capture demographic characteristics, as well as capture results of tests performed on products, substances, and environments.  Most observations are simple name/value pair assertions with some metadata, but some observations group other observations together logically, or even are multi-component observations.  Note that the  <a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReport</a> resource provides a clinical or workflow context for a set of observations and the Observation resource is referenced by DiagnosticReport to represent laboratory, imaging, and other clinical and diagnostic data to form a complete report.</p>
    <p>Uses for the Observation resource include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vital signs such as <a href="observation-example.html">body weight</a>,  <a href="observation-example-bloodpressure.html">blood pressure</a>, and <a href="observation-example-f202-temperature.html">temperature</a>
      </li>
      <li>Laboratory Data like <a href="observation-example-f001-glucose.html">blood glucose</a>, or an <a href="observation-example-f205-egfr.html">estimated GFR</a>
      </li>
      <li>Imaging results like  <a href="observation-example-bmd.html">bone density</a> or fetal measurements</li>
      <li>Clinical Findings<sup>*</sup> such as  <a href="observation-example-abdo-tender.html">abdominal tenderness</a>
      </li>
      <li>Device measurements such as  <a href="observation-example-sample-data.html">EKG data</a></li>
      <li>Device Settings such as mechanical ventilator parameters.</li>
      <li>Clinical assessment tools such as <a href="observation-example-5minute-apgar-score.html">APGAR</a> or a <a href="observation-example-glasgow.html">Glasgow Coma Score</a>
      </li>
      <li>Personal characteristics: such as  <a href="observation-example-eye-color.html">eye-color</a>
      </li>
      <li>Social history like tobacco use,  family support, or cognitive status</li>
      <li>Core characteristics like pregnancy status, or a death assertion</li>
      <li>Product quality tests such as pH, Assay, Microbial limits, etc. on product, substance, or an environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    <sup>*</sup>The boundaries between clinical findings and disorders remains a challenge in medical ontology.  Refer to the <a href="#bnr">Boundaries</a> section below and in <a href="condition.html#bnr">Condition</a> for general guidance.  These boundaries can be clarified by profiling Observation for a particular use case.

    <h3>Core Profiles for Observation</h3>
    <p>The following set of core <a href="profiling.html">profiles</a> for the Observation resource have been defined. Implementations using the Observation resource when expressing the profile-specific concepts as structured data, <strong>SHALL</strong> conform to the specified profiles:</p>
    <table class="grid">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style="text-align:center;">Profile</th>
          <th style="text-align:center;">Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="width:15%;text-align:center;">
            <a href="observation-vitalsigns.html">Vital signs</a>
          </td>
          <td>The FHIR Vital Signs profiles set the minimum expectations for the Observation resource to record, search and fetch the vital signs (e.g. temperature, blood pressure, respiration rate, etc.) associated with a patient </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>

    <h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
At its core, Observation allows expressing a name-value pair or structured collection of name-value pairs. As such, it can support conveying any type of information desired. However, that is not its intent. Observation is intended for capturing measurements and subjective point-in-time assessments. It is not intended to be used for those specific contexts and use cases already covered by other FHIR resources.   For example, the <a href="allergyintolerance.html">AllergyIntolerance</a> resource represents a patient allergies, <a href="medicationstatement.html">MedicationStatement</a> resource: medications taken by a patient, <a href="familymemberhistory.html"> FamilyMemberHistory</a> resource: a patient's family history, <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a> resource: information about a procedure, and <a href="questionnaireresponse.html">QuestionnaireResponse</a> resource: a set of answers to a set of questions. 
</p>

<p>
The Observation resource should not be used to record clinical diagnosis about a patient or subject that are typically captured in the <a href="condition.html">Condition</a> resource or the <a href="clinicalassessment.html">ClinicalAssessment</a> resource. The Observation resource is often referenced by the Condition resource to provide specific subjective and objective data to support its assertions, including symptoms and assessments of the presence or absence of diagnostically significant phenomena. Symptoms may sometimes be recorded as Conditions if no etiology has yet been identified, or if the symptom is severe enough to merit independent treatment, but in most cases a symptom can be represented in an Observation with a relationship to the Condition of concern. There will however be situations of overlap. For example, a response to a question of "have you ever taken illicit drugs" could in principle be represented using MedicationStatement, but most systems would treat such an assertion as an Observation.  In some cases, such as when source data is coming from an <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=185">HL7 V2</a> feed, a system might not have information that allows it to distinguish diagnosis, allergy and other "specialized" types of observations from laboratory, vital sign and other observation types intended to be conveyed with this resource.  In those circumstances, such specialized observations may also appear using this resource. Adhering to such convention is an appropriate use of Observation. If implementers are uncertain whether a proposed use of Observation is appropriate, they are encouraged to consult with implementers on <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/"> chat.fhir.org implementer's stream</a>
</p>

<p>
When an Observation instantiates an <a href="observationdefinition.html">ObservationDefinition</a>, the elements of the Observation resource are expected to inherit their content from the corresponding definitional elements declared in the ObservationDefinition resource listed <a href="observationdefinition.html#8.26.2">here</a>. 
</p>

<p>
In contrast to the Observation resource, the <a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReport</a> resource typically includes additional clinical context and some mix of atomic results, images, imaging reports, textual and coded interpretation, and formatted representations.  Laboratory reports, pathology reports, and imaging reports should be represented using the DiagnosticReport resource. The Observation resource is referenced by the DiagnosticReport to provide the atomic results for a particular investigation.  "Laboratories routinely have a variable that is summative across a series of discrete variables - these are usually called 'impressions' or 'interpretations'. Sometimes they are algorithmically specified and sometimes they have the imprimatur of pathologists and they are conveyed in Observation or DiagnosticReport instead of the <a href="clinicalassessment.html">ClinicalAssessment</a> resource.  The Observation resource should not be used to record clinical diagnosis about a patient or subject as discussed above.
</p>

<p>
The Observation resource is used extensively for observations about people, groups, devices, locations, substances, and procedures – not about the record describing these entities. For example, <a href="devicealert.html">DeviceAlert</a> represents a single alert or alarm condition detected and signaled by a patient-connected health / medical device to create clinician’s awareness of a patient safety risk that needs to be addressed, whereas Observation captures any evidentiary data needed to interpret the alert condition or that is the reason why the alert condition is present.
</p>

<p>The Observation resource contains several elements related to the origin and quality of the observation. To record more detailed information about the source of an Observation, the <a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a> resource may be used. More in-depth commentary about or evaluation of the Observation record itself may be recorded in <a href="artifactassessment.html">ArtifactAssessment</a>.

<p><b>Note to Balloters:</b>
A new <code>organizer</code> element (trial-use) is added to the normative Observation resource in this ballot. The OO Work Group is seeking reviewers and implementer feedback on this new element, which is intended to help clarify and make explicit when an instance of the Observation resource is used for organizing/grouping sets of sub-observations (e.g., for laboratory panel/battery result reporting).  This capability is particularly applicable for use in laboratory result reporting, but it can also be used as appropriate with other types of observations.
