<h2>FHIR Change History</h2>
<p>
Changes from the DSTU ballot (v0.11) to the DSTU final copy (0.20?):
</p>
<ul>
 <li>All resources: make a rule that any contained resources must be explicitly referred to from other content in the resource</li>
 <li>ResourceReference: remove "type" element - it had no actual function</li>
 <li>Bundle - add the "fhir-base" link that SHALL be present if relative references are found in the bundle</li>
 <li>JSON - rename "_id" to "id", and change the way that primitive types are represented (split id and extension out into _[name])</li>
 <li>Documents &amp; Messages: document that these are marked with tags to identify them</li>
 <li>Extensions: make rules around obligations for exchange</li>
 <li>REST API: The syntax of the URLs has changed (remove @ from the ids). resources are no longer returned on create/update/transaction, and rules around the transction response have changed. <a href="http://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a> is now recommended (and in the conformance resource).</li>
 <li>Searching: clarify that searching is not just for rest. Extend _sort parameter. Add relevance score, and sorting by that. Add _profile parameter. Change "integer" type to "number"</li>
 <li>Choice: remove choice and add Coding.valueset</li>
 <li>CodeableConcept: move primary to Coding.primary</li>
 <li>Coding: add primary, valueset and version &amp; align code system version rules with core principles</li>
 <li>Conformance: Add Conformance.profile. Move system operations to rest.operations from rest.resource.operations, &amp; add updateCreate and versionSpecificUpdates flags</li>
 <li>ValueSet: add define.version, and a new constraint that codes must be unique in the definition space, and tighten up publication (maps and cross links, expansions, deal with poly-heirarchies &amp; deprecated codes, publish all v3 code systems, map the data types), add more uniqueness variants</li>
 <li>The following pages have been rewritten (Editorial changes only): "Resource Definitions", "Using codes" and the overview page</li>
 <li>FamilyHistory: change the value set for relation type to use the v3 value set directly</li>
 <li>Remove Coverage resource</li>
 <li>ImagingStudy: add link to DiagnosticOrder. Trim mappings to DICOM. Limit URL to WADO-RS only (not WADO)</li>
 <li>ImmunizationProfile - rename to ImmunizationRecommendation</li>
 <li>DocumentReference: aligned definitions more closely with XDS. Worked over the XDS Profile</li>
 <li>DocumentManifest: added this from scratch to round out XDS support</li>
 <li>Document: revised status list per o-o analysis of reporting cycles</li>
 <li>Validation: added Profile tags, and explained how they are used for validation</li>
 <li>Standardised identifiers: AdverseReaction, AllergyIntolerance, CarePlan, Condition, FamilyHistory, Procedure, Questionnaire all have identifier 0..*</li> 
 <li>Condition &amp; Procedure: several changes around relatedItem</li>
 <li>Procedure: made type a required element, changed type and cardinality for indications and complications, and updated definition of procedure</li>
 <li>CarePlan: made patient optional, and reworked to link activites to goals and goals to concerns, and allow other resource kinds for activities</li>
 <li>Alert: improved the definitional documentation</li>
 <li>Message: make the event code a Coding (also in the conformance statement too)</li> 
 <li>Patient: Add Link structure to support typed, unidirectional links between Patient records</li>
 <li>Profile: Remove the concept of re-useable bindings, and collapse binding in line to element definition. Change definition.type.bundled to definition.type.aggregation, and add more invariants about uniqueness</li>
 <li>Add Informative ConceptMap resource</li>
 <li>Change the following fields from string|CodeableConcept to just CodeableConcept: Encounter.reason, MedicationDispense.dispense.dosage.additionalInstructions, MedicationPrescription.reasonForPrescribing, MedicationPrescription.dosageInstruction.additionalInstructions</li>
 <li>Harmonize the search parameters for the metadata parts of Conformance, Profile, ValueSet, and ConceptMap. Remove the text parameter type, and add search parameters _text and _content. Remove token modifiers :code and :anyns, and update documentation. Remove date modifiers and use &lt; etc. Define escaping for search parameters</li>
</ul>
