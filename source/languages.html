<p>
In general, with regard to human language, the content in resources falls into one of three categories
</p>
<ol>
 <li>The content is language neutral</li>
 <li>The content has a specified language</li>
 <li>There are multiple representations of the same content in different languages</li>
</ol>
<p>
The vast majority of clinical content is language neutral - the language is either unknown
or unspecified, and assumed to be in the natural language predominant in the 
implementation environment. Note that this doesn't mean that the content is all in
the same language - often, snippets of other language content will creep in 
where patients or providers themselves are multi-lingual, but there is no formal 
tracking for such content, and it will often be translated in situ for the benefit
of all users.
</p>
<p>
While most applications are entirely language neutral, many healthcare 
applications must deal with multi-lingual content. This page provides a 
roadmap to the facilities in the FHIR specification for supporting multiple 
languages.
</p>
<p>
FHIR offers the following facilities for dealing with languages:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="#lang">Language tag on Resource and Narrative</a></li>
 <li><a href="#ext">Translation Extension</a></li>
 <li><a href="#term">Translations on CodeSystem and ValueSet</a></li>
 <li><a href="#translatable">Translatable extension on element definition</a></li>
 <li><a href="#http">Language Tags on HTTP requests</a></li>
 <li><a href="#names">Languages in Names and Addresses</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="spec"></a>
<h3>Specification</h3>
<p>
The specification itself is published and balloted in English (US). 
There are projects to translate this to other languages (e.g. 
<a href="http://fhir-ru.github.io/index.html">Russian </a> and 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fhirjp/">Japanese</a>), but these 
are generally not well maintained.
</p>

<p>
One consequence of the way the specification works is that the element 
names (in either JSON or XML) are in English. These should be considered
as references into the specification; they’re never meant to be meaningful 
to any one other than a user of the specification itself, and are never
intended to be displayed to end-users of any healthcare application.
</p>

<p>
What may be displayed to users are the display terms for codes and elements,
which can be managed as described below. This has been done for some 
codes/elements and languages (e.g. see <a href="valueset-languages.html#definition">Common
Languages</a>), and further contributions from affiliates or implementers is
welcome. 
</p>

<a name="lang"></a>
<h3>Language tag on Resource and Narrative</h3>
<p>
Every resource has an optional <a href="resource-definitions.html#Resource.language"><code>language</code></a>
element that is the base language for the content of the resource. Note that this does not 
require that all the content of the resource be in the specified language; just that unless
otherwise specified, this is the default language of the content. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, an <code>xml:lang</code> attribute can be specified on the <code>html:div</code> element
(or any element in the HTML). This can be used to specify a language in addition to the resource 
language. Note that it doesn't really make sense to specify a different language on the narrative
than on the resource itself; the xml:lang attribute is allowed to support natural language processing
of the narrative.
</p>
<p>
Where resources contain the same documentation in several different languages, each
different languages should use a <code>div</code> element with an XHTML lang 
attribute in the root div. By default, all languages will be displayed to a user, 
but multi-language aware applications can filter the content by language and only display the 
language that is relevant to or chosen by the patient.
</p>
<p>
See the W3C documentation on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech-lang/">Language declarations</a> for further information.
</p>

<p>
Note that  the choice of locale from the "Accept-language" headers MAY change syntax of resource narrative (e.g., date formats, number formats).
</p>

<a name="ext"></a>
<h3>Translation Extension</h3>

<p>
All human readable character content (any elements of type <a href="datatypes.html#string">string</a>
and <a href="datatypes.html#markdown">markdown</a>) has the same language as that specified by 
the resource language element. Whether or not a language is specified, translations may be provided
for any human readable character content. Translations are provided using the <a href="extension-translation.html">translation
extension</a>:
</p>
<pre class="json">
{ 
  "url" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/translation",
  "extension" : [{
    "url" : "lang", 
    "valueCode" : "de"
  },{
    "url" : "content",
    "valueString" : "einige übersetzte Wörter"
  }]
}
</pre>
<p>
Multiple translations can be provided if more than one language is required. 
</p>

<a name="term"></a>
<h3>Translations on CodeSystem and ValueSet</h3>

<p>
Concepts defined in <a href="codesystem.html">CodeSystem</a> resources can have 
one or more designations that provide additional representations for the concept (<a href="codesystem-definitions.html#CodeSystem.concept.designation">CodeSystem.concept.designation</a>):
</p>
<pre class="json">
{
  "code": "de",
  "display": "German",
  "designation": [{
      "language": "nl",
      "value": "Duits"
    },{
      "language": "ru",
      "value": "Немецкий"
    },
    {
      "language": "zh",
      "use": {
        "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/designation-usage",
        "code": "display"
      },
      "value": "德语"
    }
  ]
}
</pre>
<p>
The base display ("German" in this case) is in the language specified on the resource.
Applications using the code system can pick the appropriate language based on the 
context and/or relevant parameters when using the code system. Alternate designations
can also be specified when concepts are include in value sets (<a href="valueset-definitions.html#ValueSet.compose.include.concept.designation">ValueSet.compose.include.concept.designation</a>).
</p>


<a name="translatable"></a>
<h3>Translatable extension on element definition</h3>

<p>
All elements in FHIR resources or data types are defined by an 
<a href="elementdefinition.html">ElementDefinition</a>. Element
Definitions provide several different descriptions for each
element, the most important of which are <a href="elementdefinition-definitions.html#ElementDefinition.label">label</a>
and <a href="elementdefinition-definitions.html#ElementDefinition.definition">definition</a>. These
(and other <a href="datatypes.html#string">string</a>
and <a href="datatypes.html#markdown">markdown</a> properties on the element definition
can have translations using the extension shown above. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to this, elements can be marked with the <a href="extension-elementdefinition-translatable.html">translatable
extension</a>:
</p>
<pre class="json">
{ 
  "url" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-translatable", 
  "valueBoolean" : true
}
</pre>
<p>
This indicates that applications should consider supporting translations when
reading/writing this element.
</p> 

<a name="http"></a>
<h3>Language Tags on HTTP requests</h3>

<p>
HTTP Requests can include a header to indicate which language is requested:
</p>
<pre>
Accept-Language: de-DE
</pre>
<p>
The header can contain multiple languages, with weighted preferences. 
Servers can use the header to return the correct language if they are 
able. If the request is a search, the server may choose to limit matches
to those that contain the correct language, though this might be unsafe.
</p>
<p>
HTTP Responses can include a header to indicate which language is in
the resource:
</p>
<pre>
Content-Language: en-US
</pre>
<p>
If present, the content language header must match the language of 
the resource (if specified).
</p>

 <li><a href="#names">Languages in Names and Addresses</a></li>

<a name="names"></a>
<h3>Languages in Names and Addresses</h3>

<p>
Names and addresses are one area of special difficulty with regard to
multiple languages. Inherently, names and addresses only have one 
language, but they may have approximations in other languages, or 
people may choose to take entirely different names for different cultures.
Some of the <a href="datatypes-examples.html#HumanName">name examples</a>
illustrate how this is handled.
</p>
<p>
One common practice in some cultures is the represent the same name 
twice, in local and western scripts. These can be differentiated by
the script portion of the <a href="extension-language.html">language extension</a>:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;name&gt;
    &lt;extension url=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/language&quot;&gt;
      &lt;valueCode value=&quot;ru-RU-Cyrl&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
    &lt;family value=&quot;ЕМЕЛИН&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;given value=&quot;ИВАН&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;given value=&quot;ВЛАДИМИРОВИЧ&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;
    &lt;extension url=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/language&quot;&gt;
      &lt;valueCode value=&quot;ru-RU-Latn&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
    &lt;family value=&quot;EMELIN&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;given value=&quot;IVAN&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;given value=&quot;VLADIMIROVICH&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/name&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The different scripts can also be differentiated by the Unicode subsets that they 
contain, but this is not always convenient.
