<h3>Extensible binding examples</h3>

<h4>Condition.code with Extensible binding</h4>
<p>For example, we have a Condition.code and the applicable profile binds the code to the value set <a href="http://build.fhir.org/valueset-condition-code.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/condition-code</a> 
with an Extensible binding:</p>

<pre class="json">{
  "path": "Condition.code",
  "definition" : "Identification of the condition, problem or diagnosis."
  "binding": {
    "strength": "extensible",
    "valueSetCanonical": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/condition-code"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>This value set includes all SNOMED CT concepts that are clinical findings.</p> 
  
<a name="extensible.c1"></a>
<h3>Condition instance #1</h3>

<pre class="json">{
  "resourceType": "Condition",
  "code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
        "code": "39065001",
        "display": "Burn of ear"
      }
    ],
    "text": "Burnt Ear"
  },
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/example"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>This concept (code = 39065001) is included in the value set so the instance is valid.</p>
  
<a name="extensible.c2"></a>
<h4>Condition instance #2</h4>

<pre class="json">{
  "resourceType": "Condition",
  "code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
        "code": "312824007",
        "display": "Family history of cancer of colon"
      }
    ]
  },
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/example"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>This SNOMED CT concept is not a clinical finding. So is it valid? 
With the extensible binding 2 questions must be answered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there an applicable code in the bound value set (condition-code) for &#8216;family history of cancer of colon&#8217;?  
That doesn&#8217;t appear to be the case, so the instance is valid in that respect.</li>
<li>Does this code fit into the definition of the element in the profile: &#8220;Identification of the condition, problem or diagnosis.&#8221;?  
That also appears likely to be the case.  But that isn&#8217;t entirely clear, which is the challenge of extensible bindings.</li>
</ul>

<p>So this example is most likely valid (based on human review).</p>

<a name="extensible.c3"></a>
<h4>Condition instance #3</h4>
    
<pre class="json">{
  "resourceType": "Condition",
  "code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://my-local-organization.com",
        "code": "XYZ123",
        "display": "Severe pneumococcal pneumonia"
      }
    ]
  },
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/example"
  }
}
</pre>
    
<p>This Condition instance contains a local code.  Is it a valid instance? With the extensible binding, the same questions as before have to be answered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there an applicable code in the bound value set (condition-code) for &#8216;Severe pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217;?
In this case SNOMED CT <b>does</b> have the code 233607000 for &#8216;Pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217;.  
Since &#8216;Pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217; is a more general meaning which "covers" (i.e. includes or subsumes) 
&#8216;Severe pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217;, this Condition instance is <b>not valid</b> and the SNOMED CT code  
233607000 for &#8216;Pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217; SHALL be used instead.</li>
<li>Does this code fit into the definition of the element in the profile: &#8220;Identification of the condition, problem or diagnosis.&#8221;?  
Yes, it does.  But since it was already determined that there is an applicable code in the bound value set that should be
used instead, this instance is not valid.</li>
</ul>

<a name="extensible.c4"></a>
<h4>Condition instance #4</h4>
<p>What if we would like to send our local code for &#8216;Severe pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217; in the instance along with
the SNOMED CT code 233607000 for &#8216;Pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217;?  Because the datatype for Condition.code is CodeableConcept, 
we can do that using an additional Coding (as a translation):
</p>
    
<pre class="json">{
  "resourceType": "Condition",
  "code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
        "code": "233607000",
        "display": "Pneumococcal pneumonia"
      },
      {
        "system": "http://my-local-organization.com",
        "code": "XYZ123",
        "display": "Severe pneumococcal pneumonia"
      }
    ]
  },
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/example"
  }
}
</pre>
    
<p>So this is a valid Condition instance which contains both the applicable SNOMED CT code from the extensibly bound 
condition-code value set for &#8216;Pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217; as well as my organization's local code for 
&#8216;Severe pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217;.</p>

<h3>Preferred binding examples</h3>

<p>The choice of code with a Preferred binding is considerably simpler than for an Extensional binding, because the Preferred
binding is a suggestion from the developers of the resource or profile about which codes they believe would be best to use to
represent this data. However, in a particular instance you are free to choose to follow that suggestion or not, depending on your
particular desires and needs, and there are no specific conformance expectations regarding that choice.   
</p>
<p>So in this case we have a Condition.code and the applicable profile binds the code to the value set 
<a href="http://build.fhir.org/valueset-condition-code.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/condition-code</a>
with a Preferred binding:</p>

<a name="preferred.c1"></a>
<h4>Condition.code with Preferred binding</h4>

<pre class="json">{
  "path": "Condition.code",
  "definition" : "Identification of the condition, problem or diagnosis."
  "binding": {
    "strength": "preferred",
    "valueSetCanonical": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/condition-code"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>With the Preferred binding all of the following instances (and many other possibilities) are valid instances of the 
Condition resource:</p>

<h4>Condition instance #5</h4>

<pre class="json">{
