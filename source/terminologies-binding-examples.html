<h3>Examples for Required bindings</h3>

<h4>On an element of type code</h4>
<p>
Most elements of type code have a required binding e.g. status elements. 
</p>
<pre class="json">
{
  "path" : "CodeSystem.status",
  "definition" : "The status of this code system. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the content.",
  "binding" : {
    "strength" : "required",
    "description" : "The lifecycle status of an artifact.",
    "valueSet" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/publication-status|5.0.0"
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
These bindings generally have a version specific finding (a 'static' binding). 
The code must come from the indicated value set:
</p>

<pre class="json">
{
  "resourceType" : "CodeSystem",
  "id" : "example",
  "url" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/example",
  "status" : "draft"
}
</pre>

<h4>On an element of type CodeableConcept</h4>
<p>
Required bindings are generally not used on elements of type CodeableConcept in the 
base FHIR specification, but such bindings are commonly found in profiles - indeed, 
narrowing the binding to a specific required value set is one of the basic things 
profiles exist for. 
</p>

<p>For example, we have a Condition.code and the applicable profile binds the code to 
  the value set <code>http://acme.com/fhir/ValueSet/problem-codes</code> 
  with an Extensible binding:</p>
  
  <pre class="json">{
    "path": "Condition.code",
    "definition" : "Identification of the condition, problem or diagnosis."
    "binding": {
      "strength": "required",
      "valueSetCanonical": "http://acme.com/fhir/ValueSet/problem-codes"
    }
  }
  </pre>
  
  <p>
  This value set includes the SNOMED CT concepts 282542002 (Unable to stop running), 
  282548003 (Unable to avoid obstacles when running), and 219389008 (War injury due to fragments from rocket). 
  </p> 
    
  <a name="required.c1"></a>
  <h3>Condition example instance</h3>
  
  <pre class="json">
  {
    "resourceType": "Condition",
    "code": {
      "coding": [
        {
          "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
          "code": "282548003",
          "display": "Unable to avoid obstacles when running"
        }
      ],
      "text": "Doomed to run into things always"
    },
    "subject": {
      "reference": "Patient/coyote"
    }
  }
  </pre>
  
  <p>This concept (code = 282548003) is included in the value set so the instance is valid, but if 
    the code 21902005 (Struck by falling rock or stone) was present, it would not be valid. It's also
    not valid to provide just a text when there's a required binding.</p>

<a name="extensible"></a>
<h3>Examples for Extensible bindings</h3>

<h4>Condition.code with Extensible binding</h4>
<p>For example, we have a Condition.code and the applicable profile binds the code to the value set <a href="valueset-condition-code.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/condition-code</a> 
with an Extensible binding:</p>

<pre class="json">{
  "path": "Condition.code",
  "definition" : "Identification of the condition, problem or diagnosis."
  "binding": {
    "strength": "extensible",
    "valueSetCanonical": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/condition-code"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>This value set includes all SNOMED CT concepts that are clinical findings.</p> 
  
<a name="extensible.c1"></a>
<h3>Condition instance #1</h3>

<pre class="json">{
  "resourceType": "Condition",
  "code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
        "code": "39065001",
        "display": "Burn of ear"
      }
    ],
    "text": "Burnt Ear"
  },
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/example"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>This concept (code = 39065001) is included in the value set so the instance is valid.</p>
  
<a name="extensible.c2"></a>
<h4>Condition instance #2</h4>

<pre class="json">{
  "resourceType": "Condition",
  "code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
        "code": "312824007",
        "display": "Family history of cancer of colon"
      }
    ]
  },
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/example"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>This SNOMED CT concept is not a clinical finding. So is it valid? 
With the extensible binding 2 questions must be answered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there an applicable code in the bound value set (condition-code) for &#8216;family history of cancer of colon&#8217;?  
That doesn&#8217;t appear to be the case, so the instance is valid in that respect.</li>
<li>Does this code fit into the definition of the element in the profile: &#8220;Identification of the condition, problem or diagnosis.&#8221;?  
That also appears likely to be the case.  But that isn&#8217;t entirely clear, which is the challenge of extensible bindings.</li>
</ul>

<p>So this example is most likely valid (based on human review).</p>

<a name="extensible.c3"></a>
<h4>Condition instance #3</h4>
    
<pre class="json">{
  "resourceType": "Condition",
  "code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://my-local-organization.com",
        "code": "XYZ123",
        "display": "Severe pneumococcal pneumonia"
      }
    ]
  },
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/example"
  }
}
</pre>
    
<p>This Condition instance contains a local code.  Is it a valid instance? With the extensible binding, the same questions as before have to be answered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there an applicable code in the bound value set (condition-code) for &#8216;Severe pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217;?
In this case SNOMED CT <b>does</b> have the code 233607000 for &#8216;Pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217;.  
Since &#8216;Pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217; is a more general meaning which "covers" (i.e. includes or subsumes) 
&#8216;Severe pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217;, this Condition instance is <b>not valid</b> and the SNOMED CT code  
233607000 for &#8216;Pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217; SHALL be used instead.</li>
<li>Does this code fit into the definition of the element in the profile: &#8220;Identification of the condition, problem or diagnosis.&#8221;?  
Yes, it does.  But since it was already determined that there is an applicable code in the bound value set that should be
used instead, this instance is not valid.</li>
</ul>

<a name="extensible.c4"></a>
<h4>Condition instance #4</h4>
<p>What if we would like to send our local code for &#8216;Severe pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217; in the instance along with
the SNOMED CT code 233607000 for &#8216;Pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217;?  Because the datatype for Condition.code is CodeableConcept, 
we can do that using an additional Coding (as a translation):
</p>
    
<pre class="json">{
  "resourceType": "Condition",
  "code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
        "code": "233607000",
        "display": "Pneumococcal pneumonia"
      },
      {
        "system": "http://my-local-organization.com",
        "code": "XYZ123",
        "display": "Severe pneumococcal pneumonia"
      }
    ]
  },
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/example"
  }
}
</pre>
    
<p>So this is a valid Condition instance which contains both the applicable SNOMED CT code from the extensibly bound 
condition-code value set for &#8216;Pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217; as well as my organization's local code for 
&#8216;Severe pneumococcal pneumonia&#8217;.</p>
        
<a name="preferred"></a>
<h3>Examples for Preferred bindings</h3>

<p>The choice of code with a Preferred binding is considerably simpler than for an Extensional binding, because the Preferred
binding is a suggestion from the developers of the resource or profile about which codes they believe would be best to use to
represent this data. However, in a particular instance you are free to choose to follow that suggestion or not, depending on your
particular desires and needs, and there are no specific conformance expectations regarding that choice.   
</p>
<p>So in this case we have a Condition.code and the applicable profile binds the code to the value set 
<a href="valueset-condition-code.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/condition-code</a>
with a Preferred binding:</p>

<a name="preferred.c1"></a>
<h4>Condition.code with Preferred binding</h4>

<pre class="json">{
  "path": "Condition.code",
  "definition" : "Identification of the condition, problem or diagnosis."
  "binding": {
    "strength": "preferred",
    "valueSetCanonical": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/condition-code"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>With the Preferred binding all of the following instances (and many other possibilities) are valid instances of the 
Condition resource:</p>

<a name="preferred.c2"></a>
<h4>Condition instance #5</h4>

<pre class="json">{
  "resourceType": "Condition",

        "code": "39065001",
        "display": "Burn of ear"
      }
    ],
    "text": "Burnt Ear"

        "display": "Severe pneumococcal pneumonia"
      }
    ]
  },
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/example"
  }
}
</pre>

<a name="preferred.c6"></a>
<h4>Condition instance #8</h4>

<pre class="json">{
  "resourceType": "Condition",
  "code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
        "code": "233607000",
        "display": "Pneumococcal pneumonia"
      },
      {
        "system": "http://my-local-organization.com",
        "code": "XYZ123",
        "display": "Severe pneumococcal pneumonia"
      }
    ]
  },
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/example"
  }
}
</pre>


<a name="example"></a>
<h3>Examples for Example bindings</h3>

<p>
There are many elements defined in the FHIR specification for which there is no
agreement in the HL7 community about what codes should be used. Usually, the lack
of agreement is due to disagreement between jurisdictions, and lack of economic 
incentive to standardise the element. In these cases, the FHIR specification provides
a few illustrative codes, but there is no attempt to ensure that these provide
good coverage of the problem space, or that they are carefully defined, and 
implementers SHOULD NOT assume that the codes are production ready. Instead,
implementers should look in applicable implementation guides or guidance, or 
use or create their own codes for us.
</p>
<p>
Some examples of example bindings in this specification:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="account-definitions.html#Account.billingStatus">Account.billingStatus</a></li>
  <li><a href="observation-definitions.html#Observation.code">Observation.code</a></li>
  <li><a href="encounter-definitions.html#Encounter.type">Encounter.type</a></li>
</ul>
