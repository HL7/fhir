<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p> 
A document manifest gathers a set of <a href="documentreference.html">Document Reference</a> resources 
into a single package that may be the subject of workflow such as access control, auditing, and 
targeted delivery. 
</p>
<p>
Typically, Document Manifest Resources are used in document indexing systems, such as IHE XDS (see the <a href="xds.html">XDS specific profile</a>).
