<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>

<p>The ActorDefinition Resource represents an actor that can play the role of a participant 
in some kind of described process.<p>

<p>
ActorDefinitions can be referenced in several places:
<li>[<a href="examplescenario.html">ExampleScenarios</a>] which show how data might flow in different situations.</li>
<li>[<a href="plandefinition.html">PlanDefinition</a>] which defines how a workflow should/is allowed to occur amongst a set of actors.</li>
<li>[<a href="requirements.html">Requirements</a>] which defines higher level expectations about system capabilities.</li>
<li>The [<a href="obligations.html.html">obligation</a>] extension, which allows system behaviors to be defined on a per-element basis.</li>
<li>[<a href="capabilitystatement.html">CapabilityStatement</a>] which allows pointing to ActorDefinitions to describe the specific sets of functionality supported by (or that should be supported by) systems (via obligations)</li>
</p>
