<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>

<p>The ActorDefinition Resource an actor that can plays the role of a participant in some kind 
of described process. Generally, in the scope of FHIR, the process is some kind of data 
exchange, and ActorDefinition is defined for this purpose.</p>

<p>
However it's also possible to use actors in descriptions and definitions of clinical business 
flows, though FHIR itself does not provide a business process description language, nor will it. 
The intention of the ActorDefinition is that other business process languages will refer the
actors and in doing so, bring into scope the technical artifacts associated with the actor.
