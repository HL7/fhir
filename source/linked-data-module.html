<h2>FHIR Linked Data Module</h2>

<a name="intro"> </a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This module describes the RDF representation for FHIR resources (FHIR/RDF) and related assets, including an OWL ontology for FHIR/RDF and a ShEx grammar to validate FHIR/RDF.  
<i>Linked Data</i> is structured data that is represented in an RDF format
to facilitate inference and data linkage across datasets.
</p>
<p>
Materials in this module are created and maintained by a collaboration between HL7 and <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>.  Editor: David Booth

<h4>Motivation and Design of the FHIR Linked Data Module</h4>
<p>
Although RDF formats can be used to exchange FHIR data, 
the primary purpose of the FHIR Linked Data Module is to ground FHIR data semantics in 
RDF, as a universal information representation.
This enables FHIR data to be used with RDF applications, to support
inference, shared semantics across multiple standards and data formats,
data integration, semantic data validation, 
compliance enforcement, SPARQL queries and other uses.
</p>

<p>
The FHIR/RDF is based on the same abstract FHIR information model
as the <a href="xml.html">XML</a> and <a href="json.html">JSON</a> formats, and carries the same FHIR
information content. FHIR data is losslessly round-trippable between XML, JSON and RDF formats.  
For this reason, data expressed in FHIR/RDF corresponds closely to the XML and JSON formats 
in its look and feel.  However, there are a few additional terms that may appear in the RDF format, which are explained on 
<a href="rdf.html">the RDF page</a>: <code>fhir:nodeRole</code>, <code>fhir:treeRoot</code>, <code>fhir:value</code>, <code>fhir:index</code> and <code>fhir:concept</code>.
</p>

<p>
Ontologies that were designed independently almost always have some impedance mismatch when attempting to use them together.  
Many of the ontologies in the medical and life sciences domain are
designed to capture facts about the world for research, such as the fact
that the mitral valve is a kind of heart valve.  But FHIR was designed
to support the day-to-day operations of healthcare providers exchanging
electronic health records (EHRs), and in this context the orientation has
historically been different.  
When using FHIR/RDF with other ontologies,
impedence differences are likely to show up in two main ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Records versus facts.</b>  FHIR is oriented toward recording who did what ("Dr. Jones diagnosed patient x with viral pneumonia") rather than stating absolute medical facts ("patient x has viral pneumonia").  
</li>
<li>
<b>Non-monotonicity.</b>  RDF was designed to be monotonic, whereas FHIR has a few design aspects that are would be non-monotonic if they were interpreted directly in RDF.  (Monotonicity means that new data cannot invalidate previous conclusions; non-monotonicity means that previous conclusions can be invalidated by new data.)  For example, a modifier extension indicates that the surrounding element's meaning will likely be misunderstood if the modifier extension is not understood.  
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For both of these reasons, to maintain monotonicity in RDF, FHIR/RDF
should not be directly interpreted as stating facts, at least until
any potentially non-monotonic elements have been removed or isolated
through pre-processing.
</p>

<p>
Application developers should also be aware that some FHIR data attributes
have a major impact on the interpretation of the enclosing data element:
the meaning of the enclosing element cannot be determined in isolation.
For example, a status of 'entered-in-error' means that the resource was 
created accidentally, and should be ignored.

<h4>FHIR/RDF Data Formats</h4>
<p>
FHIR/RDF examples are provided for all FHIR resources in both Turtle and JSON-LD formats.   
To access a JSON-LD example, first navigate to that example in Turtle format,
and then click the "JSON-LD" link above the Turtle example.
</p>
<p>
The mime type for the Turtle format is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#sec-mediaReg"><code>text/turtle</code></a>. <br />
The mime type for the JSON-LD format is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#application-ld-json"><code>application/ld+json</code></a>.

<h3>Using FHIR/RDF</h3>
<p>
Application developers wishing to use FHIR/RDF will often need to perform
the following rough steps, though exact steps will depend on your application:
<ol>
<li>Convert FHIR/XML or FHIR/JSON data to/from FHIR/RDF.
Open source implementations that can perform this conversion include:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://hapifhir.io/">HAPI java Reference library</a> (Same code as used in the build)</li>
<li><a href="http://fhir3.healthintersections.com.au/open">Reference Server</a> (based on <a href="http://github.com/grahamegrieve/fhirserver">Delphi reference implementation</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mvdzel/fhir-net-api">fhir-net-api</a>, a .NET implementation. (should work on <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a>)</li>
<li>Check the <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Open_Source_FHIR_implementations">HL7 Open Source FHIR Implementations page,</a> in case new implementations have become available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="downloads.html">Download</a> the FHIR ontology.
</li>

<li> Download other ontologies that you wish to use with your application,
such as the SNOMED-CT ontology.  (Because of license restrictions,
the process of obtaining the SNOMED-CT ontology is more complex than
a simple download.  Some <a href="http://owl.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/snomed/">guidance is provided here</a>.)
</li>

<li> Create or obtain a bridge ontology that relates terms in the FHIR
ontology to terms in your other ontologies.
</li>

<li> Load your FHIR/RDF instance data and your ontologies into
a reasoner and/or a triplestore, and perform SPARQL queries and/or
reasoning.
</li>

<li> If you are creating FHIR/RDF then you might also wish to validate
it, using <a href="http://shex.io/">ShEx</a>.
If so, you can <a href="fhir.shex">download the ShEx schema</a> for FHIR/RDF.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/Talks/1205-swat4ls-egp/reasoning">Slides by Eric Prud'hommeaux</a> illustrate how inference can be used on FHIR/RDF data
to perform a query for FHIR Observations of rheumatoid arthritis,
using the <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/healthit/snomedct/international.html">SNOMED-CT ontology</a>.
<i>Caveat: those slides show some terms in the fhir: namespace that
do not actually exist in the fhir: namespace, such as
fhir:Observation-of-Rheumatoid_arthritis-disorder and
fhir:Coding-of-Rheumatoid_arthritis-disorder.  A different namespace
should have been used in the example.</i>

<h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
<p>
The use of RDF does not raise any known security or privacy issues beyond
those already existing for FHIR/XML or FHIR/JSON.
For more general considerations, see <a href="secpriv-module.html">the Security and Privacy module</a>.
</p>

<p>
RDF can also be used to help enforce security and privacy policies.

<h3>Developmental Roadmap</h3>
<p>
<i>In this section: what the current overall state is, what work is in train, what the goals over the next 18 months or so are.</i>
</p>
<p>
Most of the major pieces of FHIR/RDF are now available in a complete
enough form for developers to start trying them and providing feedback.
Work still needed:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Further editing of FHIR Linked Data module pages. </li>

<li> <a href="https://hl7-fhir.github.io/ontology">FHIR Ontology Introductory Page</a>.  This still needs to be drafted, perhaps based the
<a href="http://w3c.github.io/hcls-fhir-rdf/spec/ontology.html">FHIR Ontology draft on W3C github</a>. </li>

<li> Tutorial on using FHIR/RDF with other ontologies (such as
the SNOMED-CT ontology) and performing inference.
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/Talks/1205-swat4ls-egp/reasoning">Eric Prud'hommeaux's slides</a>
or <a href="http://w3c.github.io/hcls-fhir-rdf/spec/ontology.html">Tony Mallia's AllergyIntolerance example</a>
may be a good starting point. </li>

<li> Tutorial on using <a href="http://shex.io/extensions/Map/">ShExMap</a> to translate other RDF data (non-FHIR) to/from FHIR/RDF. </li>
