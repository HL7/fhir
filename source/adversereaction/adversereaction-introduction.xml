<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
Adverse Reaction resources are used to provide information about specific 
reactions to a substance.  These are normally associated with an 
<a href="allergyintolerance.html">AllergyIntolerance</a> resource,
but can be reported on their own when no assumption of further reactions 
is being made, or when specific events are being described.
</p>

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
An Adverse Reaction normally has a set of signs or symptoms that are 
reported in the Symptom class. However, it is possible to convey that 
an adverse reaction occurred without knowing the specific signs or 
symptoms that occurred, e.g. <i>Some unknown reaction occurred.</i>
Similarly, it is possible to convey that an adverse reaction with 
a set of symptoms occurred but not indicate the substance if it 
is not known.  e.g. <i>A rash occurred for some unknown reason.</i>
</p>
<p>
The Exposure class is used to indicate a set of exposures 
that preceded the reaction. There is no assertion of causality, 
purely a statement of timing. Each exposure can indicate a 
substance that might be different from the reaction if needed.
