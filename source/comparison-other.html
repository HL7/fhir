<h2>Other HL7 Standards</h2>
<table class="colsi"><tr><td id="wg">Responsible Owner: <a _target="blank" href="[%wg fhir%]">[%wgt fhir%]</a> Work Group</td><td id="ballot"><a href="versions.html#std-process">Standards Status</a>:<!--!ns!--><a href="versions.html#std-process">Informative</a></td></tr></table>
<p>
HL7 has produced a number of other standards that don't overlap with FHIR as closely as those listed above, primarily because they aren't focused solely on information exchange.  However, they deserve a brief mention:
</p>

<h3>EHR Functional Model (EHR-FM)</h3>
<p>
This specification defines a number of functional behaviors for Electronic Health Record systems.  FHIR is a healthcare information exchange standard that can be used to satisfy some of these functional behaviors.  Details on how FHIR fits into the EHR-FM can be found <a href="ehr-fm.html">here</a>
</p>

<h3>Context Management (FHIRCast)</h3>
<p>
FHIRcast synchronizes healthcare applications in real time to show the same clinical content to a common user.
For example, a radiologist often works in three disparate applications at the same time (a radiology information system, a PACS and a dictation system),
she wants each of these three systems to display the same study or patient at the same time. 
Note that HL7 had an earlier specification called CCOW (Clinical Context Object Workgroup) that allowed for independent systems to synchronize context
on a single workstation, but this has been retired and replaced by FHIRcast.
</p>

<h3>Arden Syntax</h3>
<p>
Arden Syntax is a language for defining decision support rules.  These rules reference data elements that are used as part of the decision making process.  However, the specification does not define how these data elements are identified.  FHIR element and extension identifiers would provide one mechanism for identifying the relevant data elements.
</p>

<h3>Virtual Medical Record</h3>
<p>
The Virtual Medical Record is a draft specification under development by HL7 that also serves the decision support space.  It defines a logical medical record that decision support rules can be constructed against.  At present, this model is a custom model created specifically for VMR.  However, the Decision Support work group is evaluating the possibility of using FHIR as a structure for future versions of the specification.
