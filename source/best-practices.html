<p>
The base FHIR specification is used across the world in many different
contexts, with a great variety of use cases. There are many existing 
restrictions from common practice and regulation that constrain the 
agreements that the specification represents. In particular there are 
large amounts of existing data in legacy record stores that need to be
represented and exchanged using FHIR resources.
</p>
<p>
The requirements analysis that occurs during the design of the FHIR
process often leads to a clear understanding of how information should
be represented, but also can make clear that for a variety of reasons, 
such best practices cannot be imposed as standards requirements in 
all contexts. However, it is useful for the FHIR standard to be able to 
document what are known best practices. 
</p>
<p>
Committees can document best practice by one of two different ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li>defining invariants and marking them as best practice rules</li>
<li>adding narrative that defines best practices</li>
</ul>

<p>
When using the <a href="validation.html">FHIR validator</a>, implementers
are able to ask for best practice rules to be enforced if they wish.
