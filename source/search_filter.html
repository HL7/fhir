<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
<code>_filter</code> is a parameter that can be used with the <a href="search.html">Search Operation</a>.
It uses the same set of standard parameters defined for the resources, and provides a syntax
for expressing a set of query expressions on the underlying resources.
</p>

<p>Examples of filters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Patient: name co "pet"</code> - all patients with the characters "pet" in a given or family name</li>
<li><code>Patient: given eq "peter" and birthdate ge 2014-10-10</code> - all patients with a given name of peter, born on or after 10-Oct 2014</li>
<li><code>Observation: code eq http://loinc.org|1234-5</code> - all observations with the LOINC code "1234-5"</li>
<li><code>Observation: subject.name co "pet"</code> - all observations on a patient with the characters "pet" in a given or family name</li>
<li><code>Observation: related[type eq "has-component"].target pr true</code> - all observations that have component observations (note: this uses one of the search parameters defined for this mechanism, see below)</li>
<li><code>Observation: related[type eq has-component].target re Observation/4</code> - all observations that have Observation/v as a component</li>
</ul>

<p>
The _filter syntax has the following features:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A filter can be a logical one (x or x, or x and x, or not x).</li>
<li>A filter can contain other filters in a set of parentheses: "()".</li>
<li>A filter can be a test - path operation value, where operation is taken from the table below, and value is either a "true", "false", a JSON string, or a token (any sequence of non-whitespace characters, excluding ")" and "]". Values are never case sensitive.</li>
<li>A 'path' is a name, with chained searches done by name.name etc.as per existing source. There can also be a filter: name[filter].name.</li>
<li>The name is one of the defined search parameters that are used with the other search mechanism, with some special exemptions defined below.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note: The only difference between a "string" value and a "token"
value is that a string can contain spaces and ')' and ']'. There is
otherwise no significant difference between them.
</p>
<p>
Formal grammar for the syntax:
</p>
<pre>
filter        = paramExp / logExp / ("not") "(" filter ")"
logExp        = filter ("and" / "or" filter)+
paramExp      = paramPath SP compareOp SP compValue
compareOp     = (see table below)
compValue     = string / numberOrDate / token
string        = json string
token         = any sequence of non-whitespace characters (by Unicode rules) except "]" and ")"
paramPath     = paramName (("[" filter "]") "." paramPath)
paramName     = nameCharStart (nameChar)*
nameCharStart = "_" / ALPHA
nameChar      = "_" / "-" / DIGIT / ALPHA
numberOrDate  = DIGIT (DateChar)*
dateChar      = DIGIT / "T" / "-" / "." / "+"
</pre>

<p>Notes about using the syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical expressions are evaluated left to right, with no precedence between "and" and "or". If there is ambiguity, use parentheses to be explicit.</li>
<li>Rhe compareOp is always evaluated against the set of values produced by evaluating the param path.</li>
<li>Rhe parameter names are those defined by the specification for search parameters, except for those defined below.</li>
<li>Rhe date format is a standard XML (i.e. XSD) dateTime (including time zone).</li>
</ul>

<p>This table summarizes the comparison operations available:</p>

<table class="grid">

	Note that the recommended value for the approximation is 10% of the stated value (or for a date, 10% of the gap between now and the date), but systems may choose other values where appropriate</td>
 </tr>

<li>For token, the format is the same as the existing search parameter.</li>
<li>For convenience, the codes "loinc", "snomed", "rxnorm" and "ucum" are predefined and can be used in place of their associated full namespace.</li>
