<div xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml ../../schema/xhtml1-strict.xsd" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

<p>A patient encounter is further characterized by the setting in which it takes place, amongst them are ambulatory,
 emergency, home health, inpatient and virtual encounters. An Encounter encompasses the lifecycle from pre-admission, 
 the actual encounter (for ambulatory encounters), and admission, stay and discharge (for inpatient encounters). 
During the encounter the patient may move from practitioner to practitioner and location to location.</p>

<p>Because of the broad scope of Encounter, not all elements will be relevant in all settings. For this reason, 
admission/discharge related information is kept in a separate Hospitalization component within Encounter. 
The <i>class</i> element is used to distinguish between these settings, which will guide further validation and
application of business rules.</p>

<p>There is also substantial variance from organization to organization (and between jurisdictions and countries) 
on which business events translate to the start of a new Encounter, or what level of aggregation is used for Encounter. I.e. Each
single visit of a practitioner during a hospitalization may lead to a new instance of Encounter, but depending on
use and systems involved, it may well be that this is aggregated to a single instance for the whole hospitalization.
Even more aggregation may occur where jurisdictions introduce groups of Encounters for financial or other reasons.
Encounters can be aggregated or grouped under other Encounters using the <i>partOf</i> element.</p>

<p>Encounter instances may exist before the actual encounter takes place to convey pre-admission information, including
using Encounters elements to reflect the planned start date, planned accommodation or planned encounter locations. In 
this case the <i>status</i> element is set to 'planned'.</p>


<p>Specifically outside the scope of Encounter are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group encounters - </li>
<li>Appointment information - use the Appointment resource (yet to be defined). Note that in many systems outpatient
encounters (which are in scope for Encounter) and Appointment are used concurrently. In FHIR,
Appointment is used for establishing a date for the encounter, while Encounter is applicable to
information about the actual Encounter, i.e. the patient showing up.</li>
</ul>
