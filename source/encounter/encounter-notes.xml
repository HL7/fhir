<ul>
<li>The <i>class</i> element describes the setting (in/outpatient etc.) in which the Encounter took place. Since this is important for 
interpreting the context of the encounter, choosing the appropriate business rules to enforce and management of the process, this element
is required.</li>
<li>The <i>Location</i> indicates where the patient has been during the encounter (he might visit multiple locations, e.g. to an MRI room
for examinations, while <i>Accommodation</i> keeps information about the bed a patient stays at during a hospitalization.</li>
