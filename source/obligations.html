<h2>Implementation Obligations</h2>

<p>
The FHIR specification is primarily concerned with valid interfaces of various kinds (APIs, messaging, etc.)
and the rules for the content in resource instances exchanged between applications. Implementation guides 
that describe specific implementation solutions and <a href="actordefinition.html">application roles</a> 
are also concerned with application behavior - what information must be provided under what conditions, and 
setting expectations for how particular data elements are handled. 
</p>
<p>
Implementation guides can make rules about the behavior of applications by using the <code>mustSupport</code>
and <code>obligation</code> features of <a href="elementdefinition.html">ElementDefinition</a> in profiles. 
</p>
<p>
Note that since the base specification is only describing the interfaces and resources, not any particular 
solution, the base application does not specify any applications obligations in the resource definitions.
</p>

<a name="mustSupport"></a>
<h3>MustSupport</h3>
<p>
Any element can be labelled as 'must-support' using the <code>mustSupport</code> flag on an 
<a href="elementdefinition.html">Element Definition</a> in an applicable profile. Labeling an 
element MustSupport means that implementations that produce or consume resources SHALL
provide "support" for the element in some meaningful way.
</p>
<p>
The <code>mustSupport</code> flag itself does not define exactly what "support" for an element 
means. When a profile contains an element labelled as "must-support", it SHALL also make clear
exactly what kind of "support" is required, as this could involve expectations around what
a system must store, display, allow data capture of, include in decision logic, pass on to
other data consumers, etc.
</p>
<p>
Profiles can make the expectations clear by either:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Providing a narrative description of the obligations associated with the element 
    as part of an implementation guide in which the profile is published, or in the 
    narrative description of the element</li>
  <li>Providing detailed expectations about the element using the <code>obligation</code> element</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that an element that has the property IsModifier is not necessarily a "key" element (e.g. one of
the important elements to make use of the resource), nor is it automatically mustSupport - however both
of these things are more likely to be true for IsModifier elements than for other elements.
</p>  

<p>
The base FHIR specification is intended to be independent of any particular implementation context, 
so no elements are flagged as <code>mustSupport</code>=true as part of the base specification, and 
no obligations are defined for any elements (except for an example profile).
</p>

<p>
When a repeating element is labelled as 'must-support', it can be ambiguous whether the intent
is that at least one of the repeating elements must be supported, or whether every element must be
supported. The must support documentation SHOULD explicitly discuss this issue, and make the
expectations in such cases clear to the implementers. In the absence of such documentation,
implementer cannot be sure what the meaning of the specification is, though the community may
issue new advice to clarify the meaning.
</p>

<h3>Obligations</h3>

<p>
If an element is labelled as "must-support", the element can specify the obligations associated
with its use by providing one or more obligations using the <%extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/obligation%>. 
For further details about how to use the obligation extension, consult <a href="<%extensions-location%>StructureDefinition-obligation.html">the extension documentation</a>.
