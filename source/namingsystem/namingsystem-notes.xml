<h3>Dealing with duplicate entries</h3>
<p>
In some cases, the same code or identifier system might accidentally be created more than once in a registry, for example because someone failed to check
for an existing entry before adding a new one or knows the same concept with a different name.  If this occurs, one of the system entries should be deleted
and the remaining entry should have its <code>uniqueId</code> updated to include any identifiers present on the original entry (and possibly have its descriptive 
information modified to include additional information from the duplicate entry).

<h3>NamingSystem.url</h3>

<p>
The NamingSystem resource has a <code>url</code> property. 
The NamingSystem resource also specifies preferred identifiers 
for the Identifier or Code system that is being described. 
These are not the same thing; the <code>url</code> property
of the NamingSystem itself identifies the registration of 
the system - the description itself, where as the preferred 
identifiers identify the system being described.
</p>
<p>
The NamingSystem.url SHOULD not be the same as a URL in the preferred identifiers 
list, and it would not therefore appear in a <code>Coding.system</code> or an <code>Identifier.system</code>.
