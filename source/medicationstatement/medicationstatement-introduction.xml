This resource is distinct from <a href="medicationprescription.html">MedicationPrescription</a>, <a href="medicationdispense.html">MedicationDispense</a> 
and <a href="medicationadministration.html">MedicationAdministration</a>.  Each of those resources refer to specific events - an individual 
order, an individual provisioning of medication or an individual dosing.  MedicationStatement is a broader assertion covering a wider 
timespan and independent of specific events.  The existence of resource instances of any of the preceding three types may be used to infer 
a Medication statement.  However, medication statements can also be captured on the basis of other information including an assertion by the 
patient or a care-giver, the results of a lab test, etc.
