<p>FHIR resources can be used to build documents that represent a composition: a coherent set of information that is a statement of healthcare information, including clinical observations and services. A document is a frozen set of resources with a fixed presentation that is authored and/or attested by humans, organizations and devices.</p>
<p>A document instance contains specific frozen versions of other resources. Changes to a document Bundle may risk invalidating the attestation present within the document.  Implementations SHOULD have policies around when documents can be 'updated' (new version of the same instance) vs. when a distinct document needs to be created, as well as what types of change are permitted, in order to retain attestation validity.  These rules might vary based on the type of document (e.g. legal documents, clinical documents, etc.)   Strict limitations on document change are sometimes referred to as 'document immutability'.</p>
<p>
Documents built in this fashion may be exchanged between systems and
persisted in document storage and management systems, including systems such as IHE
XDS.
</p>
<p>
Applications claiming conformance to this framework claim to be conformant to
"FHIR documents" (see <a href="conformance-rules.html">Conformance</a>).
</p>
<p>
FHIR documents may be 'clinical' (focused on patient healthcare information) but
may also serve non-clinical purposes (e.g. FHIR Implementation guides, practice
guidelines, patient handouts, etc.)
HL7 will develop profiles in the future giving additional guidance on appropriate
representation of clinical documents in general as well as specific types of clinical
documents (e.g. Consolidated CDA).
</p>

<p>
Note that FHIR defines both this document format and a <a href="documentreference.html">document reference resource</a>.
FHIR documents are for documents that are authored and assembled in FHIR, while the document reference resource is for
general references to pre-existing documents.
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="document-example-dischargesummary.html">Example discharge summary</a>: <a href="document-example-dischargesummary.xml.html">XML</a> or <a href="document-example-dischargesummary.json.html">JSON</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="content"></a>

<h2>Document Content</h2>

<p>
All documents have the same structure: a <a href="bundle.html">Bundle</a>
of resources of <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.type">type</a> "document"
that has a <a href="composition.html">Composition</a> resource as the first resource
in the bundle, followed by a series of other resources, referenced from the <code>Composition</code>
resource, that provide the supporting details for the document. The bundle gathers all the content
of the document into a single XML or JSON document which may be signed and managed as required.
The resources include both human readable and computer processable portions. In addition, the bundle
may include <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS stylesheets</a>,
<a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a> statements and a signature.
</p>
<p>
The composition resource is the foundation of the clinical document. It:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>provides identity and its purpose, and sets the context of the document</li>
 <li>carries key information such as the subject and author, and who attests to the document</li>
 <li>divides the document up into a series of sections, each with their own narrative</li>
</ul>
<p>
Resources referenced by the Composition as listed below SHALL be included in the bundle when the document is assembled:
</p>
<%res-ref-list Composition%>
<p>
When these resources reference other resources, the referenced resources SHOULD also be 
included in the bundle. Omitting referenced resources could compromise the integrity and 
wholeness of the document, especially when considering that documents have legal retention 
periods that may be longer than the life of the FHIR server where the reference(s) point to.
</p>
<p>
In rare cases the referenced resources in Composition can also be contained resources 
within Composition provided that the resource(s) in question meets the restrictions for 
the use of contained resources (see <a href="references.html#contained">Contained Resources</a>
for more information).
</p>
<p>
The document bundle SHALL include only:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>The Composition resource, and any resources directly or indirectly (e.g. recursively) referenced from it</li>
 <li>A Binary resource containing a stylesheet (as described below)</li>
 <li>Provenance Resources that have a target of Composition or another resource included in the document</li>
</ol>
<p>
There are two key identifiers in the document:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The document identifier (mandatory). This is found in <i>Bundle.identifier</i> and is globally unique for this instance of the document, and is never re-used, including for other documents derived from the same composition</li>
 <li>The Composition identifier (optional). This is found in <i>Composition.identifier</i>, and is the same for all documents that are derived from this composition</li>
</ul>

<p>
The document has several dates in it:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The document date (mandatory). This is found in <i>Bundle.timestamp</i> and identifies when the document bundle was assembled from the underlying resources</li>
 <li>The Composition date (mandatory). This is found in <i>Composition.date</i>, which is when the author wrote the document logically</li>
 <li>The Attestation dates (optional). This is found in <i>Composition.attester.time</i> and is when the document was witnessed by the attesters. This would usually be at the same time as the composition date or afterwards</li>
 <li>The Composition last modified time (optional). This is found in <i>Composition.meta.lastUpdated</i> for the composition and is the last date of change of the composition. This must be &gt;= the composition date</li>
</ul>
<p>
Document Bundles may be signed using digital signatures following the rules laid out in
the <a href="signatures.html">digital signatures</a> page.
The signature SHOULD be provided by a listed attester of the document and the signature
SHOULD contain a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/#sec-KeyInfo" target="_blank">KeyInfo
element</a> that contains a KeyName element whose value is a URI that matches the <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.entry.fullUri">fullUri</a> for the matching attester resource.
</p>
<p>Note that the document may be represented in either XML or JSON and interconverted between these or have its character encoding changed, all the while remaining the same document.  Any additional documents derived from the same Composition SHALL have a different Bundle.identifier.</p>

<a name="presentation"></a>
<h3>Document Presentation</h3>
<p>
When the document is presented for human consumption, applications SHOULD present the
collated narrative portions in order:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>The <a href="composition-definitions.html#Composition.subject">subject resource</a> Narrative</li>
 <li>The <a href="composition.html">Composition</a> resource Narrative</li>
 <li>The <a href="composition-definitions.html#Composition.section.text">section.text</a> Narratives</li>
</ol>
<p>
The presentation of the document is called the 'attested content' of the document. Additional resources 
included in the document that are not part of the presentation of the document are not considered attested 
content (e.g. a <a href="condition.html">Condition</a> resource). Specifically, 
the <code>Composition.attester</code> attests to the presented form of the document.
</p>
<p>
The Composition resource narrative should summarize the important parts of the document header that are required
to establish clinical context for the document (other than the subject, which is displayed in its own
right). To actually build the combined narrative, simply append all the narrative &lt;div&gt; fragments
together. <!-- todo: title -->
</p>
<p>
If the document is presented in a different order from that given above,
it might not represent the original attested content. Implementation Guides may
restrict document narrative and display behavior further.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="downloads.html#refimpl">XML Tools reference implementation</a> includes a
XSLT transform that converts an XML document into browser-ready XHTML.
</p>


<a name="css"></a>
<p>
In addition to the <a href="narrative.html#css">basic style rules about Narratives</a>, which
must be followed, a document can reference or contain one or more stylesheets that contains additional styles that
apply to the collated narrative. This is done by asserting stylesheet links on the feed:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;Bundle xmlns=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- metadata and type --&gt;
  &lt;link&gt;
    &lt;relation value=&quot;stylesheet&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;url value=&quot;[uri]&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/link&gt;
&lt;/Bundle&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The <code>url</code> can be an absolute reference to a CSS stylesheet or
a relative reference to a Binary resource that carries a
CSS stylesheet. Stylesheet references can only refer to
a CSS stylesheet - other forms of stylesheet are not acceptable.
</p>
<p>
Relative (internal) references SHOULD be used for stylesheets, because the viewer may be unable to resolve
external content at the time of viewing, due to technical problems or local policy decisions.
</p>
<p>
Any stylesheet referenced or used SHALL NOT alter the presentation in such a way
that it changes the clinical meaning of the content.
</p>
<p>
Unless otherwise agreed in local trading partner agreements, applications
displaying the collated narrative SHOULD use the stylesheets specified by the
document (see <a href="security.html#stylesheet">security note</a>). Parties entering into a trading agreement to do otherwise should
consider the implications this action will have on their long-term scope for document
exchange very carefully. If the parties agree to use stylesheets that are
not contained in the document, then it may be that they will never be able
to share their documents safely in a more general context, such as a regional
or national EHR or a global personal health record.
</p>

<a name="profiles"></a>

<h2>Document Profiles</h2>

<p>
<a href="profiling.html">Document profiles</a> are used to describe documents for a particular
purpose. Document profiles may make rules about:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The content of the Composition resource, including</li>
 <li>The structure of the sections in the composition</li>
 <li>Which resources are to be included in the bundle along with the resources that are directly referenced in the Document resource</li>
</ul>
<p>
Applications should consider publishing <a href="capabilitystatement.html">Capability Statements</a> that identify document types they support. Documents can
identify a profile that they conform to by placing a profile identifier in the <code>Bundle.meta.profile</code>
element - see <a href="resource.html#meta">Profile Tags</a> for a discussion of the utility
of this.
</p>

<a name="obligations"></a>

<h2>Document Handling Obligations</h2>
<p>
The authors/constructors and processors of Clinical Documents, whether human or software, have
obligations that they must satisfy.
</p>

<h3>Author/Constructor Obligations</h3>
<p>
A document constructor is an application that creates a document. An author
is a human, organization or device that uses the constructor to create a
document. Between them, the constructor and the author may create new
content resources and/or assemble already existing content resources while performing their tasks.
They also have the following responsibilities:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>To assure that the document SHALL contain valid composition that conforms to the rules described here and that only links to other valid resources</li>
 <li>To assure that the content of document SHALL conform to any declared <a href="profiling.html">Profiles</a> (see below).</li>
 <li>Ensure that the attesters are properly aware of the presentation of the document to which they are attesting</li>
</ul>

<h3>Processor Obligations</h3>
<p>
A document processor is an application and/or human user that receives documents and extracts data from them or makes decisions because of them. The documents may be received directly from a document constructor, accessed
via a document management system or forwarded by a third party. The document processor is responsible for
ensuring that received documents are processed and/or rendered in accordance to this specification. A
document processor has the obligation to assure that the following rules are followed:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>When storing/transmitting a document, any method may be used as long as the bundled document can be
   (re-)assembled with sufficient integrity to validate a digital signature</li>
 <li>When presenting the narrative of the document, the rules described above SHALL be followed</li>
 <li>Resources or data from the document may be extracted for additional uses, but such data is no longer considered to be attested by the document author</li>
 <li>Wherever the data from the document is displayed to a user, there SHOULD always be a way for the user to access a presentation of the original document</li>

</ul>
<p>
In addition to these obligations, document receivers SHOULD carefully track the source of
documents for new documents that supersede existing documents, particularly when the documents
represent compositions that have been retracted. When documents have been replaced,
they SHOULD either withdraw data extracted from superseded documents or warn users when
they view the document or data taken from it.
</p>

<a name="bundle"></a>
<h2>Document End-Points</h2>

<p>
There are several different RESTful end-points used when working with documents.
The use of the various end-points can best be described by considering the consequences
of posting to them:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr> <td><b>End-Point</b></td> <td><b>Type of Content</b></td> <td><b>Description</b></td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>[baseurl]/Bundle</td> <td>Document Bundle</td> <td>This works like a normal end-point
   for managing a type of resource, but it works with whole document bundles - i.e. a read operation returns a bundle,
   an update gets a bundle and a search returns a bundle of bundles. Note that if documents are POSTed
   using a <a href="http.html#create">create</a> interaction the Bundle.id will change, but the Bundle.identifier will not. See <a href="bundle.html#rest">Serving Bundles using the RESTful API</a> for further comment</td></tr>
 <tr> <td>[baseurl]/Composition</td> <td>Composition Resource</td> <td>The normal end-point for managing
   composition resources. This can be used while building a document or after breaking a document up into
   its constituent resources or when using compositions separately from documents</td> </tr>

 <tr> <td><a href="binary.html">[baseurl]/Binary</a></td> <td>Document Bundle</td> <td>Just store the entire document as
   a sequence of bytes and return exactly that sequence when requested. There is no way to find content in the /Binary end-point,
   so usually this would be associated with a <a href="documentreference.html">Document Reference</a> so that applications
   can find and process the document, though this is not required</td> </tr>

 <tr> <td><a href="http.html#transaction">[baseurl]</a> (e.g. a transaction)</td> <td>Document Bundle</td> <td>Ignore the
   fact that the bundle is a document and process all of the resources that it contains as individual resources. Clients SHOULD
   not expect that a server that receives a document submitted using this method will be able to reassemble the document exactly. (Even if the
   server can reassemble the document (see below), the result cannot be expected to be in the same order, etc.  Thus a document signature will
   very likely be invalid.). See <a href="http.html#other-bundles">Accepting other Bundle types</a> for further details</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
Note: While these end-points are defined for use with document-related resources and document bundles,
it is not necessary to use them. Documents may be transferred between systems using any method desired.
In addition, servers and/or specifications may define additional <a href="operations.html">operations</a>
for handling documents beyond the options described above.
</p>

<h3>Generating a Document</h3>
<p>
A client can ask a server to generate a fully bundled document from a composition resource.
For details, see <a href="composition-operations.html">Generate Document Operation</a>.
