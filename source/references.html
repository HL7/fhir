<h2>Internal References</h2>
<p>
There are 3 cases where elements inside a resource reference each other:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Between a ResourceReference and an <a href="references.html#contained">contained resource</a></li>
 <li>Between elements in the narrative and structured data elements</li>
 <li>An &lt;img src=""/&gt; reference in the narrative, referring to an image found in the resource (as a contained <a href="media.html">Media</a> or <a href="binary.html">Binary</a> resource)</li>
</ul>
<p>
These references are done using an id/idref based approach, where a source element indicates that it 
has the same content as the target element. The target element has an attribute "id" which SHALL 
have a unique value within the resource with regard to any other id attributes. The "id" attribute is not in any namespace.
The source element reference SHALL refer to an attribute in the same resource. 
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;example&gt;
    &lt;target id="a1"&gt;
      &lt;child&gt;...&lt;/child&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;
    &lt;-- other stuff --&gt;
    &lt;source idref="a1"&gt;
  &lt;/example&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
In a single resource, this works like xml:id/idref, but there is an important difference: the 
uniqueness and resolution scope of these id references is within the resource that contains them. If multiple
resources are combined into a single piece of XML, such as an <a href="xml.html#atom">atom feed</a>, duplicate 
values may occur between resources. This SHALL be managed by applications reading the resources.
</p>
<p>
Note that all references between the xhtml elements and the data elements must be understood to 
establish a "derived from" relationship, where the derived content (whether text or data) refers 
to the source content.  Note that this means some references may be forward references (references to 
elements defined later in the instance).
</p>
<p>
Note that internal references work exactly the same in way in JSON, based on the JSON property _id which is equivalent 
to the XML attribute "id".

<h3>References between resources</h3>
<p>
The defined elements in a resource include many references to other resources. Using these
references, the resources combine to build a web of information about healthcare. 
</p>
<p>
References are always defined in one particular direction - from one resource (source) to another (target).
The corresponding reverse relationship from the target to the source exists in a logical sense, but is 
not represented explicitly in the resource. Navigating these reverse relationships requires some 
external infrastructure to track the relationship between resources (the <a href="http.html">REST API</a> provides one such 
infrastructure by providing the ability to <a href="http.html#search">search</a> the reverse relationship by naming 
search parameters for the references).
</p>
<p>
Because resources are processed independently, relationships are not considered to be transitive. 
For example, if a <a href="condition.html">Condition</a> resource references a particular 
<a href="patient.html">Patient</a> as its subject, and it links to a <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a>
resource as its cause, there is no automatic rule or implication that the procedure 
has the same patient for its subject. Instead, the subject of the procedure must be established 
directly in the procedure itself. Another way to state this is that the context of the subject
is not "inherited" and it does not "conduct" along the relationship to procedure. 
The only exception to this in the case of contained resources (see below). Note that in
practice, the relationships do need to describe a logical and coherent record, and in the
case of the Condition and Procedure described here, they would usually be required to have
the same patient for their subjects.
</p>

<p>
In a resource, references are represented with a reference and a text description. 
The <i>reference</i> is the key element - resources are identified and addressed by their URL.
The actual reference looks like this (see <a href="formats.html#syntax">"XML Format"</a>
for details of the way resource contents are described):
</p>

[%dt ResourceReference%]

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The <i>reference</i> element contains a url that is either an absolute URL, or a relative URL that is relative to the <a href="http.html#root">Service Base URL</a>, or an internal fragment reference (see below)</li>
 <li>Using absolute URLs provides a stable scalable approach suitable for a cloud/web context, while using relative/logical references provides a 
   flexible approach suitable for use when trading across closed ecosystem boundaries. (see <a href="use.html#identity">implementation issues for further discussion</a>)</li>
 <li>Absolute URLs do not need to point to a <a href="http.html">FHIR RESTful server</a>, though this is the preferred approach. If the tail of the reference 
   conforms to the structure "/[Type]/[id]" or "/[Type]/[id]/history/[vid]" then it should be assumed that the reference is to a <a href="http.html">FHIR RESTful server</a>. 
   Whether or not the reference is to a FHIR RESTful server, the reference SHALL point to a Resource as defined by this specification</li>
 <li>URLs are always considered to be case-sensitive and lowercase is preferred</li>
 <li>The <i>display</i> is generally not the same content as the Resource.text of the referenced resource.  The purpose is to 
   identify what's being referenced, not to more fully describe it</li>
</ul>

<div class="use">
<p><b>Constraints</b></p>

  &lt;/profile&gt;
</pre>
<p><i>Note that HL7 has not yet actually created a profile registry, nor decided on a URL for it</i>.</p>
<p>
A short display text that provides a human-readable identification of the resource may be provided:
</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="ResourceReference">
  &lt;custodian&gt;
    &lt;reference value="Organization/123" /&gt;
    &lt;display value="HL7, Inc" /&gt;
  &lt;/custodian&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This text can be used by a system that is unable to resolve the reference to an actual resource.

</div>

<a name="contained"> </a>
<h3>Contained Resources</h3>
<p>
In some circumstances, the content referred to in the resource reference does not have an independent 
existence apart from the resource that contains it - it cannot be identified independently, and nor 
can it have its own independent transaction scope. Typically, such circumstances arise where the resource
is being assembled by a secondary user of the source data, such as a middleware engine. If the data available
when the resource is constructed does not include record keys or absolute identification information, then
a properly identified resource cannot be assembled, and even if an arbitrary identification was associated
with it, the resource could never be the subject of a transaction outside the context of the resource that
refers to it.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider a situation where an interface engine is creating a <a href="condition.html">Condition</a>
record on a patient from an HL7 v2 message, and the only information about the primary surgeon is her 
first name and lastname (REL-7.2 &amp; RES-7.3). In the absence of a controlled practitioner directory, 
this is not enough information to create an identified <a href="practitioner.html">Practitioner</a> 
resource - more than one practitioner might have the same name. 
name. 
</p>
<p>
In these circumstances, the resource is placed directly in line in the resource. <b>This SHOULD NOT be 
done when the content can be identified properly, as once identification is lost, it is extremely difficult 
(and context dependent) to restore it again.</b>
</p>
<div class="example">
<p>
An example of a contained resource:
</p>
<pre class="xml"> <!-- Can't fragment test this - too incomplete -->
 &lt;Document xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir"&gt;
  &lt;extension&gt;...&lt;/extension&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;...&lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;contained&gt;
    &lt;Organization id=&quot;org1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;!-- whatever information is available --&gt;
    &lt;/Organization&gt;
  &lt;/contained&gt;
  &lt;information&gt;
    &lt;!-- other attributes --&gt;
    &lt;custodian&gt;
      &lt;reference value="#org1" /&gt;
    &lt;/custodian&gt;
    &lt;!-- other attributes --&gt;
  &lt;information&gt;
 &lt;/Document&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The same example in JSON:
</p>
<pre class="json"> 
{ "Document" : {
  "extension" : { ... },
  "text" : { .. },
  "contained: [
    {"Organization" : {
      "_id" : "org1",
      .. whatever information is available ...
	}}
  ]
  "information: {
    ... other attributes ...
    "custodian" : {
      "reference" : { "value" : "#org1" }
	}
    ... other attributes ...
  }
}}
</pre>
</div>

<div class="design-note">
<p>
Design Note: Contained resources are still a reference rather than being inlined directly 
into the element that is the reference (e.g. "custodian" above) to ensure that a
single approach to resolving resource references can be used. Though direct containment
would seem simpler, it would still be necessary to support internal references where the 
same contained resource is referenced more than once. In the end, all that it would achieve
is creating additional options in the syntax. For users using XPath to process the resource,
the following XPath fragment resolves the internal reference: 
</p>
<pre>
ancestor::f:*[not(parent::f:*)]/f:contained/*[@id=substring-after(<b>current()</b>/f:reference/@value, '#')]
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Some notes about use and interpretation of contained resources:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contained resources share the same internal id resolution space as the parent resource</li>
  <li>Contained resources SHALL NOT not contain additional contained resources</li>
  <li>Contained resources SHOULD not contain any narrative</li>
  <li>Resources that are contained inline also "inherit" context from their parent resource. For instance, if 
    the parent resource contains a "subject", and the contained resource also has a subject element defined, 
    but does not specify any subject, a processing application may infer that the subject is the same. Note,
    however, that such inferences are specific to a particular circumstance. There is no rule, for instance, 
	that the meaning of the "subject" element is the same in both parent and contained resources</li>
</ul>

<a name="atom-refs"> </a>
<h3>Resolving references to Resources</h3>
<p>
Readers of the resources bundles should always look through the resources in the 
atom feed when a <a href="#Resource">resource reference</a> is encountered. 
The resource reference may have a relative url, which is the id of the target, like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml" fragment="ResourceReference">
  &lt;institution&gt;
    &lt;reference value="Organization/23" /&gt;
  &lt;/institution&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
A reader trying to find the resource this <i>institution</i> element identifies 
should always look through the entries in the atom feed prior to looking 
anywhere else for the institution. If the feed.id for the resource that contains
the link above is http://example.org/, then the absolute 
URL is http://example.org/Organization/23. If that organization is in the feed, 
it would look like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml">
   .. feed ..
  &lt;entry>
    .. 
    &lt;id>http://example.org/Organization/23&lt;id>
    .. 

    &lt;content type="text/xml">
      &lt;Organization xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir">
         &lt;!-- Content for the resource --&gt;
      &lt;/Organization>
    &lt;/content>
  ... feed ...
</pre>
</div>
<p>
It would also be possible to locate the resource by an absolute url. In this case, 
the <i>id</i> element contains a direct reference to the location of the resource:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml" fragment="ResourceReference">
  &lt;institution&gt;
    &lt;reference value="http://example.org/Organization/23" /&gt;
  &lt;/institution&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>

If there is no resource in the atom feed with an appropriate URL, then 
the application may try accessing the provided URL directly or use some 
other implementation-specific method for resolving how to find the resource.
</p>
