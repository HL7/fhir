<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p><strong>This resource is a <em>definition</em> resource from a FHIR workflow perspective</strong> - see <a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a>, specifically <a href="workflow.html#definition">Definition</a>.</p>

[%impl-note%]
The EventDefinition has been deprecated in favor of the <a href="subscriptiontopic.html">SubscriptionTopic</a> resource as the preferred resource for the representation of event definitions.
[%end-note%]

<p>The EventDefinition provides a reusable description of an event. The resource supports describing different kinds of events, including named events, periodic events, and data-based events. For each of these, the resource also supports a formal description of the event. For example, a 'monitor-emergency-admissions' event can be a named event, but also provide a formal description of the event as monitoring for encounters that occur in emergency department locations.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>The EventDefinition resource is intended to be used to provide a reusable description of events for use by other resources that require event definition, such as Subscription. EventDefinition is a definition of an event that could occur, whereas Subscription is asking for notification of events when they occur.</p>
