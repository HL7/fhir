<h2>RESTful API</h2>
<p>
Each resource type has the same set of interactions defined that can be used to manage the resources
in a highly granular fashion. Applications claiming conformance to this framework
claim to be conformant to "RESTful FHIR".
</p>
<p>
Note that in this RESTful framework, transactions are performed directly on the server resource using an
HTTP request/response. The API does not directly address authentication, authorization, and audit
collection - for further information, see the <a href="security.html">Security Page</a>.
</p>
<p>
The API describes the FHIR resources as a set of operations (known as "interactions") on resources where individual
resource instances are managed in collections by their type. Servers can choose which of
these interactions are made available and which resource types they support. Servers SHALL
provide a <a href="conformance.html">conformance statement</a> that specifies what interactions and
resources are supported.
</p>
<p>
The following logical interactions are defined:
</p>
<a name="interactions"> </a>
<a name="operations"> </a>
<table class="list">
  <tr><td><b>Instance Level Interactions</b></td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="#read">read</a></td><td>Read the current state of the resource</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="#vread">vread</a></td><td>Read the state of a specific version of the resource</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="#update">update</a></td><td>Update an existing resource by its id (or create it if it is new)</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="#delete">delete</a></td><td>Delete a resource</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="#history">history</a></td><td>Retrieve the update history for a particular resource</td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2"><b>Type Level Interactions</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="#create">create</a></td><td>Create a new resource with a server assigned id</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="#search">search</a></td><td>Search the resource type based on some filter criteria</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="#history">history</a></td><td>Retrieve the update history for a particular resource type</td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2"><b>Whole System Interactions</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="#conformance">conformance</a></td><td>Get a conformance statement for the system</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="#transaction">transaction</a></td><td>Update, create or delete a set of resources as a single transaction</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="#history">history</a></td><td>Retrieve the update history for all resources</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="#search">search</a></td><td>Search across all resource types based on some filter criteria</td></tr>
</table>
<p>In addition to these operations, there is a <a href="messaging.html#mailbox">Mailbox</a> and <a href="documents.html#bundle">Document</a> endpoint.</p>

<p><b>Style Guide</b></p>
<p>
URL operations on this pages are defined like this:
</p>

<pre>
  OPERATION [base]/[type]/[id] {?_format=[mime-type]}
</pre>
<ul>
 <li>The first word is the HTTP verb used for the operation</li>
 <li>Content surrounded by [] is mandatory, and will be replaced the string literal identified. Possible insertion values:
   <ul>
     <li><b>base</b>: The <a href="#root">Service Root URL</a></li>
     <li><b>mime-type</b>: The <a href="#mime-type">Mime Type</a></li>
     <li><b>type</b>: The name of a resource type (e.g. "Patient")</li>
     <li><b>id</b>: The <a href="resources.html#metadata">Logical Id</a> of a resource</li>
     <li><b>vid</b>: The <a href="resources.html#metadata">Version Id</a> of a resource</li>
     <li><b>compartment</b>: The name of a <a href="extras.html#compartment">compartment</a></li>
     <li><b>parameters</b>: URL parameters as defined for the particular operation</li>
   </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Content surrounded by {} is optional</li>
</ul>
<a name="root"> </a>
<a name="general"> </a>
<h3>Service Root URL</h3>
<p>
The Service Root URL is the address where all of the
resources defined by this interface are found. The Service
Root URL takes the form of
</p>
<pre>
http(s)://server{/path}
</pre>
<p>
The path portion is optional, and does not include a trailing slash. Each
resource type defined in this specification has a manager (or "entity set")
that lives at the address "/[type]" where the
"type" is the name of the resource type.
For instance, the resource manager for the type
"Patient" will live at:
</p>
<pre>
https://server/path/Patient
</pre>
<p>
All the logical interactions are defined relative to the service root
URL. This means that if the address of any one FHIR resource on a system
is known, the address of other resources may be determined.
</p>
<p>
Note: All URLs (and ids that form part of the URL) defined by this specification are case sensitive.</p>
<p>
Note that a server may use a path of the form "http://server/...[xx]..." where the [xx] is some variable
portion that identifies a particular instantiation of the FHIR API. Typically, the variable id
identifies a patient or a user, and the underlying information is completely compartmented
by the logical identity associated with [xx]. In this case, the FHIR API presents a
patient or user centric view of a record, where authentication/authorization is
explicitly granted to the URL, on the grounds that some identifiable user is associated
with the logical identity. It is not necessary to explicitly embed the patient id in the
URL - see <a href="extras.html#compartments">Compartments</a> for an alternative approach.
</p>

<h3>Resource Metadata and Versioning</h3>
<p>
Each resource has an associated set of <a href="resources.html#metadata">resource metadata elements</a>. These map to the http request and response using the following fields:
</p>
<table class="grid">
  <tr><th>Metadata Item</th><th>Where found in HTTP</th></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="resources.html#metadata">Logical Id (.id)</a></td><td>The Id is represented explicitly in the URL</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="resources.html#metadata">Version Id (.meta.versionId)</a></td><td>The Version Id is represented in the ETag header. It SHOULD also be returned
    as a full canonical URL in the content-location header (see <a href="#vread">vread</a> below)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Last modified (.meta.lastUpdated)</td><td>HTTP Last-Modified header</td></tr>
</table>
<p></p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
Using HTTPS is optional, but all production exchange of healthcare data SHOULD use SSL and additional security as appropriate. See <a href="security.html#http">HTTP Security</a> for further information.
</p>
<p>
Note: to support browser-based client applications, recommend that servers SHOULD implement <a href="http://enable-cors.org/">cross-origin resource sharing</a> for the operations documented here.
</p>
<a name="httpstatuscodes"> </a>
<h3>HTTP Status Codes</h3>
<p>
This specification makes rules about the use of specific HTTP status codes
in particular circumstances where the status codes SHALL map to particular
states correctly, and only where the correct status code is not obvious.
Other HTTP status codes may be used for other states as appropriate, and this particularly
includes various authentication related status codes and redirects.
Authentication redirects should not be interpreted to change the location
of the resource itself (a common web programming error).
</p>
<p>
FHIR defines an <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome resource</a> that can be used to convey specific detailed
processable error information. For a few combinations of interactions and specific
return codes, an OperationOutcome is required to be returned as the content of the response.
The OperationOutcome may be returned with any HTTP 4xx or 5xx response, but is not required - many of
these errors may be generated by generic server frameworks underlying a FHIR server.
</p>
<p>
Clients may use the If-Modified-Since, or If-None-Match HTTP header on a GET request.
If so, they MUST accept either a 304 Not Modified as a valid status code on the response (which means that the
content is unchanged since that date) or full content (either the content has not changed,
or the server does not support conditional request).
</p>
<p>
Servers can return 304 Not Modified where content is unchanged since the
If-Modified-Since date-time or the If-None-Match ETag specified or they can
return the full content as normal. This optimisation is relevant in
reducing bandwidth for caching purposes and servers are encouraged but
not required to support this.
</p>

<a name="mime-type"> </a>
<h3>Content Types and encodings</h3>
<p>
The formal MIME-type for FHIR resources is application/xml+fhir or application/json+fhir.
The correct mime type SHALL be used by clients and servers:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>XML: <b>application/xml+fhir</b></li>
 <li>JSON: <b>application/json+fhir</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
Servers SHALL support server-driven content negotiation
as described in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html#sec12">section 12</a>
of the HTTP specification.
</p>
<p>
However in order to support various implementation limitations, servers SHOULD
support the optional "_format" parameter to specify alternative response formats by their MIME-types.
This parameter allows a client to override the header value when it is unable to set it correctly
due to internal limitations.
For the _format parameter, the values "xml", "text/xml", "application/xml", and "application/xml+fhir" SHALL be interpreted to mean
the normative XML format defined by FHIR and "json", "application/json" and "application/json+fhir" SHALL be interpreted to mean the
informative JSON format.
</p>
<p>
FHIR uses UTF-8 for all request and response bodies. Since the HTTP specification (section 3.7.1)
defines a default character encoding of ISO-8859-1, requests and responses SHALL explicitly set
the character encoding to UTF-8 using the 'charset' parameter of the MIME-type in the Content-Type header.
Requests MAY also specify this charset parameter in the Accept header and/or use the Accept-Charset header.
</p>

<a name="versioning"> </a>
<h3>Support for Versions</h3>
<p>
Servers that support this API SHOULD provide full version support - that is, populate and track
versionId correctly, support vread, and implement <a href="#versionaware">version aware updates</a>.
Supporting versions like this allows for related systems to track the correct version of information,
and to keep integrity in clinical records. However, many current operational systems do not
do this, and cannot easily be re-engineered to do so.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, Servers are allowed to not provide versioning support: this API does not enforce
that they are supported. Clients may elect to only interact with servers that do provide full
versioning support. Systems declare their support for versioning
in their <a href="conformance-definitions.html#Conformance.rest.resource.noVersion">conformance statement</a>.
</p>

<a name="read"> </a>
<h3>read</h3>
<p>
The read interaction accesses the current contents of a resource. The interaction
is performed by an HTTP GET command as shown:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [base]/[type]/[id] {?_format=[mime-type]}
</pre>
<p>
This returns a single instance with the content specified for the resource type.
This url may be accessed by a browser. The possible values for the
<a href="resources.html#metadata">Logical Id</a> (id) itself are described in the <a href="datatypes.html#id">id type</a>.
The returned resource SHALL have an id element with a value that is the [id].
Servers SHOULD return an ETag with the versionId and a content-location header with the response which is the full version
specific url (see vread below) and a Last-Modified header.
</p>
<p>
Note: Unknown resources and deleted resources are treated differently on a read: A GET for a deleted
resource returns a 410 status code, whereas a GET for an unknown resource returns 404. Systems that do
not track deleted records will treat deleted records as an unknown resource.
</p>


<a name="vread"> </a>
<h3>vread</h3>
<p>
The vread interaction preforms a version specific read of the resource. The interaction
is performed by an HTTP GET command as shown:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [base]/[type]/[id]/_history/[vid] {?_format=[mime-type]}
</pre>
<p>
This returns a single instance with the content specified for the resource type for that
version of the resource.
The returned resource SHALL have an id element with a value that is the [id], and a meta.versionId
element with a value of [vid].
</p>
<p>
The <a href="resources.html#metadata">Version Id</a> (vid) is an opaque identifier that conforms to the same <a href="datatypes.html#id">format requirements</a> as
a <a href="resources.html#metadata">Logical Id</a>. The id may have been found by performing a history interaction (see below), by recording the
version id from a content location returned from a read or from a version specific reference in a
content model. If the version referred to is actually one where the resource was deleted, the
server should return a 410 status code.
</p>
<p>
Servers are encouraged to support a version specific retrieval of the current version of the
resource even if they are do not provide access to previous versions. If a request
is made for a previous version of a resource, and the server does not support accessing
previous versions, it should return a 404 Not Found error, with an operation outcome
explaining that history is not supported for the underlying resource type.
</p>

<a name="update"> </a>
<h3>update</h3>
<p>
The update interaction creates a new current version for an existing resource or
creates a new resource if no resource already exists for the given id.
The update interaction is performed by an HTTP PUT command as shown:
</p>
<pre>
  PUT [base]/[type]/[id] {?_format=[mime-type]}
</pre>
<p>
The submitted resource SHALL have an id element with a value that is the [id].
If the client submits a <a href="resource.html#meta">meta</a>, the server SHALL
ignore the existing versionId and lastUpdated values.
The server SHALL create/update the meta.versionId
and meta.lastUpdated with it's current correct values. The server is allowed to
review and alter the other metadata values, but should refrain from doing so
(see <a href="resource.html#meta">metadata description</a> for further information).
</p>

<p>
If the interaction is successful, the server SHALL return either a 200 OK if the resource was updated, or a 201 Created if the resource was created,
with a Last-Modified header, and an ETag header which contains the new versionId of the resource. A Content-Location header that refers to the specific version created by the
update interaction SHOULD also be returned. The server MAY send an OperationOutcome resource with hints and warnings about the resource; if one is sent it SHALL not include any errors.
</p>
<p>
A server SHOULD accept the resource as submitted when accepts the update, and return the same
content when it is subsequently read. However systems may not be able to do this; see
the note on <a href="#transactional-integrity">transactional integrity</a> for discussion.
</p>
<p>
Servers are permitted to reject update interactions because of integrity concerns or business
rules implemented on the server, and return HTTP status codes accordingly (usually 422).
A server SHOULD accept the resource as submitted when accepts the update, and return the same
content when it is subsequently read. However systems may not be able to do this; see
the note on <a href="#transactional-integrity">transactional integrity</a> for discussion.
</p>
<p>
Common HTTP Status codes returned on FHIR-related errors (in addition to normal HTTP errors related to security, header and content type negotiation issues):
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>400 Bad Request</b> - resource could not be parsed or failed basic FHIR validation rules</li>
 <li><b>404 Not Found</b> - resource type not supported, or not a FHIR end point</li>
 <li><b>405 Method Not allowed</b> - the resource did not exist prior to the update, and the serer does not allow client defined ids</li>
 <li><b>409/412</b> - version conflict management - see above</li>
 <li><b>422 Unprocessable Entity</b> - the proposed resource violated applicable FHIR profiles or server business rules. This should be accompanied by an <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome</a> resource providing additional detail</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note: Servers MAY choose to preserve XML comments, instructions, and formatting or JSON whitespace when accepting updates, but are not required to do so. The impact of this on digital signatures may need to be considered.
</p>

<h3>Managing Resource Contention</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/04/Editing/">Lost Updates</a>, where two clients update the same
resource, and the second overwrites the updates of the first, can be prevented using a combination
of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.19">ETag</a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.24">If-Match</a> header.
</p>
<p>
To support this usage, servers SHOULD always return an ETag with each resource:
</p>
<pre class="http">
HTTP 200 OK
Date: Sat, 09 Feb 2013 16:09:50 GMT
Last-Modified: Sat, 02 Feb 2013 12:02:47 GMT
ETag: 23
Content-Type: application/json+fhir
</pre>
<p>
if provided, the value of the ETag SHALL match the value of the version id for the resource. Servers
are allowed to generate the version id in whatever fashion that they wish, so long
as they are valid according to the <a href="datatypes.html#id">id</a> data type,
and are unique within the address space of all versions of the same resource.
When resources are returned as part of a bundle (e.g. see <a href="#search">search</a> below), the server
should return the ETag value as an attribute named "etag" in the FHIR namespace
("http://hl7.org/fhir") on the feed.entry element (or, for JSON, a property "etag" on the
feed.entry object).
</p>
<p>
If the client wishes to request a version aware update, it submits the request with an
If-Match header that quotes the ETag from the server:
</p>
<pre class="http">
PUT /Patient/347 HTTP/1.1
If-Match: 23
</pre>
<p>
If the versionId given in the If-Match header does not match, the server returns a
412 Pre-condition failed status code instead of updating the resource.
</p>
<p>
Servers can require that clients provide an IF-Match header by returning 412 Pre-condition failed
status codes when no If-Match header is found.
</p>


<a name="delete"> </a>
<h3>delete</h3>
<p>
The delete interaction removes an existing resource. The interaction
is performed by an HTTP DELETE command as shown:
</p>
<pre>
  DELETE [base]/[type]/[id]
</pre>
<p>
A delete interaction means that <a href="#read">non-version specific reads</a> of a resource
return a 410 error and that the resource is no longer found through search interactions. Upon successful
deletion the server should return 204 (No Content). The server MAY send an OperationOutcome resource with hints and warnings about the deletion; if one is sent it SHALL not include any errors.
</p>
<p>
If the server refuses to delete resources of that type on principle, then it should return the status code
405 method not allowed. If the server refuses to delete a resource because of reasons specific
to that resource, such as referential integrity, it should return the status code 409 Conflict.
If the resource cannot be deleted because it does not exist on the server, the server SHALL return 404 (Not found).
Performing this interaction on a resource that is already deleted has no effect, and should return 204.
Resources that have been deleted may subsequently be brought back to life by PUTting an update to them
subsequent to the deletion.
</p>
<p>
Many resources have a status element that overlaps with the idea of deletion. Each resource type
defines what the semantics of the deletion interactions are. If no documentation is provided, the
deletion interaction should be understood as deleting the record of the resource, with nothing
about the state of the real-world corresponding resource implied.
</p>
<p>
DELETEing a resource does not delete it's version history. From a version history respect,
deleting a resource is the equivalent of creating a special kind of history entry that has
no content and is <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.entry.status">marked as deleted</a>.
</p>

<a name="create"> </a>
<h3>create</h3>
<p>
The create interaction creates a new resource in a server assigned location. If the client
wishes to have control over the id of a newly submitted resource, it should use the update
interaction instead. The create interaction is performed by an HTTP POST command as shown:
</p>
<pre>
  POST [base]/[type] {?_format=[mime-type]}
</pre>
<p>
A resource submitted for a create operation SHALL not have an id element (this is the
only case where a resource exists without an id element).
If the client submits a <a href="resource.html#meta">meta</a>, the server SHALL
ignore the existing versionId and lastUpdated values.
The server SHALL create/update the meta.versionId
and meta.lastUpdated with it's current correct values. The server is allowed to
review and alter the other metadata values, but should refrain from doing so
(see <a href="resource.html#meta">metadata description</a> for further information).
</p>
<p>
The server returns a 201 Created, and SHOULD also return a Location header which contains the new <a href="resources.html#metadata">Logical Id</a> and <a href="resources.html#metadata">Version Id</a> of the created resource:
</p>
<pre>
  Location: [base]/[type]/[id]/_history/[vid]
</pre>
<p>
Where [id] and [vid] are the newly created id and version id for the resource.
The server MAY send an OperationOutcome resource with hints and warnings about the resource; if one is sent it SHALL not include any errors.
</p>
<p>
When the resource syntax or data is incorrect or invalid, and cannot be used to create a new resource, the server returns a 400 Bad Request.
When the server rejects the content of the resource because of business rules, the server returns a 422 Unprocessible Entity error.
In either case, the server SHOULD send an operation outcome with detailed error messages describing the reason for the error.
</p>
<p>
A server SHOULD accept the resource as submitted when accepts the create, and return the same
content when it is subsequently read. However systems may not be able to do this; see
the note on <a href="#transactional-integrity">transactional integrity</a> for discussion.
</p>
<p>
Common HTTP Status codes returned on FHIR-related errors (in addition to normal HTTP errors related to security, header and content type negotiation issues):
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>400 Bad Request</b> - resource could not be parsed or failed basic FHIR validation rules</li>
 <li><b>404 Not Found</b> - resource type not supported, or not a FHIR end point</li>
 <li><b>422 Unprocessable Entity</b> - the proposed resource violated applicable FHIR profiles or server business rules. This should be accompanied by an <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome</a> resource providing additional detail</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note: Servers MAY choose to preserve XML comments, instructions, and formatting or JSON whitespace when accepting creates, but are not required to do so. The impact of this on digital signatures may need to be considered.
</p>

<a name="search"> </a>
<h3>search</h3>
<p>
This interaction searches a set of resources based on some filter criteria. The interaction can be performed by several different HTTP commands.
To search all resources at once:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [base]?[parameters] {&amp;_format=[mime-type]}
</pre>
<p>
To search a single resource type:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [base]/[type]?[parameters] {&amp;_format=[mime-type]}
  GET [base]/[type]/_search?[parameters] {&amp;_format=[mime-type]}
</pre>
<p>
To search a <a href="extras.html#compartments">compartment</a>, either all possible resources, or a single resource type, respectively:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [base]/[Compartment]/[id]/*?[parameters]  {&amp;_format=[mime-type]}
  GET [base]/[Compartment]/[id]/[type]?[parameters]  {&amp;_format=[mime-type]}
</pre>
<p>
Note that there is a specific operation defined to support <a href="patient-operations.html#everything">fetching an entire patient record</a>.
</p>
<p>
Because of the way that some user agents and proxies treat GET and POST requests, POST submissions to /_search
are also allowed with exactly the same semantics as the equivalent GET command. Servers are required
to support both GET and POST searches. All these search interactions take a series of parameters that
are a series of name'='value pairs encoded in the URL (or as an x-multi-part-form submission for a POST).
(See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#form-content-type">W3C HTML forms</a>).
Searches are processed as specified for the <a href="search.html">Search/Query handling mechanism</a>.
</p>
<p>
If the search fails, the return value is a status code 4xx or 5xx with an <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome</a>.
If the search succeeds, the return content is a <a href="extras.html#bundle">Bundle</a> with
<a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.type">type</a> = "searchset" containing the results of the search as a list of resources
in a defined order. The result list can be long, so servers may use paging. If they do, they SHALL use the method <a href="#paging">described below</a>
(adapted from <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005">RFC 5005 (Feed Paging and Archiving</a>) for breaking the
list into pages if appropriate. The server MAY also return an OperationOutcome resource with additional information about the search;
if one is sent it SHALL not include any errors, and it shall be marked with an <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.entry.status">entry
status</a> of <a href="bundle-entry-status.html#include">"include"</a>.
</p>

<a name="conformance"> </a>
<h3>conformance</h3>
<p>
The conformance interaction retrieves the server's conformance statement that defines how it supports resources.
The interaction is performed by an HTTP OPTIONS or a GET command as shown:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [base]/metadata {?_format=[mime-type]}
  OPTIONS [base] {?_format=[mime-type]}
</pre>
<p>
Applications SHALL return a <a href="conformance.html">Conformance Resource</a> that specifies which resource types and interactions are supported
for the GET command, and SHOULD do so for the OPTIONS command. If a 404 Unknown is returned from the GET, FHIR is not supported on the
nominated service url. The GET command is defined because not all client libraries are able to perform an OPTIONS command.
An ETag header SHALL be returned with the conformance resource. The value of the header SHALL change if the
conformance statement itself changes. In addition, a Content-Location header with a literal location where this version of the
conformance statement is (and will continue to be) available MAY be returned. Additional parameters that are required to be returned with
the OPTIONS command are defined in the <a href="#hdata">OMG hData RESTful Transport</a> specification.
</p>
<p>
The Conformance statement returned typically has an arbitrary id, and no meta element, though it is not prohibited.
</p>
<p>
In addition to this conformance operation, a server may also choose to provide the
standard set of interactions (read, search, create, update) defined on this page
for the <a href="conformance.html">Conformance Resource</a> end-point.
This is different to the conformance operation:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>conformance operation</td><td>returns a conformance statement describes the server's current operational functionality</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Conformance end-point</td><td>manages a repository of conformance statements (e.g. the HL7 conformance statement registry)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
All servers are required to support the conformance operation, but servers may choose whether they wish to support the conformance end-point, just like any other end-point.
</p>

<a name="transaction"> </a>
<h3>transaction</h3>
<p>
The transaction interaction submits a set of resources to be updated, created or deleted on the server.
This interaction allows multiple resources to be updated/created in a single transaction on a single server. Multiple
resources of the same or different types may be submitted, and they may be a mix of new and existing resources.
</p>
<p>
This is especially useful where one would otherwise need multiple interactions, possibly
with ar risk of loss of referential integrity if a later interaction fails (e.g. when storing
a Provenance resource and its corresponding target resource, or, on document repositories, a
document index entry and its accompanying document).
</p>
<p>
The transaction interaction is performed by an HTTP POST command as shown:
</p>
<pre>
  POST [base] {?_format=[mime-type]}
</pre>
<p>
The content of the post submission is a <a href="bundle.html">Bundle</a>.
The resources in the bundle are each processed separately as if they were an individual
<a href="#create">create</a>, <a href="#update">update</a> or <a href="#delete">delete</a>,
along with the normal processing for each (including the <a href="resource.html#meta">meta element</a>,
verification and version aware updates, subject to the note on <a href="#transactional-integrity">transactional integrity</a>).
Servers SHALL either accept all resources and return a 200 OK, along with a
response bundle, or reject all resources and return an HTTP 400 or 500 type
response. It is not an error if the submitted bundle has no resources in it.
The outcome of the processing the transaction SHALL not depend on the order
of the resources in the transaction. A resource can only appear in a transaction
once, and since some bundles may have the same resource more than once or other order
dependencies (e.g. history lists), some kinds of bundles may not be able to be used
in a transaction. Servers may choose to only accept bundles with a <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.type">type</a> "transaction".
</p>
<p><b>Processing Bundle Entries</b></p>
<p>
How each entry in the bundle is processed depends on whether there is a <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.entry.deleted">deleted entry</a>,
or else the value of the entry.status code.
</p>
<p>
If there is a deleted entry, then the entry is to be delete on the identified resource, or else:
</p>
<table class="grid">
  <tr>
   <td><b>Status Code</b></td>
   <td><b>Processing</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>create</td>
   <td>The resource is to be treated as a create. Any id provided with the resource SHALL be ignored</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>update</td>
   <td>The resource is to be treated as an updated based on the provided id. If there is no id, the transaction must be rejected</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>match</td>
   <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>include</td>
   <td>This is an error, and the transaction must be rejected</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>(missing)</td>
   <td>If the resource has no id, treat it as a create, else treat it as a </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
A transaction may include references from one resource to another in the bundle, including
circular references where resources refer to each other. If the server assigns
a new id to any resource in the bundle as part of the processing rules above,
it SHALL also update any references to that resource in the same bundle as they
are processed. References to resources that are not
part of the bundle are left untouched. Version-specific references should remain
as version=specific references after the references have been updated.
Servers SHALL be replace all matching links in the bundle, whether they are found in the resource ids,
resource references, url elements, or &lt;a href="" &amp; &lt;img src="" in the narrative.
</p>
<p>
In order to allow the client to know the id assigned to the resources by the server, the
server SHALL return a <a href="extras.html#bundle">Bundle</a> with
<a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.type">type</a> = "transaction-response" that contains one entry for each entry in the
transaction, with the resulting resource (or deleted entry).
</p>
<p>
The server MAY also return an OperationOutcome resource with additional information about the transaction; if one is sent it SHALL not include any errors if the transaction was successful.
</p>
<a name="match"> </a>
<p><b>Conditional Processing</b></p>

<p>
The application constructing a bundle may not be sure whether a particular resource will already exist
at the time that the transaction is executed; this is typically the case with reference resources such
as patient and provider. In this case, the bundle should contain a candidate resource with
a status of "match", an id, and <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.entry.search">search</a> property
</p>
<pre>
 &lt;search value="Patient?[parameters]"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This means that the server search it's local resource store for a match as specified in the
search parameters (which must conform to the servers capability for searching as specified
in its conformance statement). If the search returns no matches, the server process the
resource as a create, and ignores the provided id. If the search returns one match, the server
uses this matching resource that already exists instead, and ignores the submitted resource.
If more than one resource is found, the transaction SHALL be rejected with an error.
</p>
<p>
If the server that is processing the transaction requires version aware updates,
the client may need to reference what is the server's current version of
the resource, which is now the client's previous version:
</p>
<pre>
 &lt;meta&gt;
  &lt;versionId value="31"/&gt;
 &lt;/meta&gt;
</pre>
<p>
If the value of the versionId doesn't match the server's version (or is missing and the
server is configured to require it), the entire transaction must fail with a 412 Pre-condition
Failed message.
</p>

<a name="history"> </a>
<h3>history</h3>
<p>
The history interaction retrieves the history of either a particular resource, all resources of
a given type, or all resources supported by the system. These three variations of the history
interaction are performed by HTTP Get command as shown:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [base]/[type]/[id]/_history{?[parameters]&amp;_format=[mime-type]}
  GET [base]/[type]/_history{?[parameters]&amp;_format=[mime-type]}
  GET [base]/_history{?[parameters]&amp;_format=[mime-type]}
</pre>
<p>
The return content is a <a href="extras.html#bundle">Bundle</a> with
<a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.type">type</a> = "history" containingcontaining the specified version history,
sorted with oldest versions last, and including deleted resources, represented with a type and id, and optionally a time of deletion,
in bundle.entry.deleted:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;entry&gt;
    &lt;deleted&gt;
      &lt;type value=&quot;Patient&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;id value=&quot;23424&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;instant value=&quot;2014-11-13T17:08:23+11:00&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/deleted&gt;
  &lt;/entry&gt;
</pre>
<p>
In addition to the standard _format parameter, the parameters to this interaction may also include:
</p>
<table class="list">
  <tr><td>_count : <a href="datatypes.html#integer">integer</a></td><td>single</td><td>Number of return records requested. The server is not bound to return the number requested, but cannot return more</td></tr>
  <tr><td>_since : <a href="datatypes.html#integer">instant</a></td><td>single</td><td>Only include resource versions that were created at or after the given instant in time</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The history list can be restricted to a limited period by specifying a _since parameter which contains a full date time with time zone.
Servers SHALL ensure that if a client uses the feed.meta.lastUpdated date from the last response they received as
the value of the _since parameter, no versions will be missed. Clients should be aware that due to timing imprecision,
they may receive notifications of a resource update on the boundary instant more than once. Servers are
not required to support a precision finer than by second.
</p>
<p>
The updates list can be long, so servers may use paging. If they do, they SHALL use the method <a href="#paging">described
below </a> for breaking the list into pages if appropriate.
</p>
<p>
The history interaction can be used to set up a subscription from one system
to another, so that resources are synchronized between them. Systems receiving such feeds and planning
on enforcing resource integrity should note that <a href="#transaction">transaction</a> boundaries
are not reflected in the history list nd plan accordingly. Refer to the <a href="subscription.html">Subscription reosurce</a>
for an alternate means of system synschronization.
</p>

 <a name="tags"> </a>
<h3>Meta Interaction</h3>

<p>
The <a href="resource.html#meta">meta element</a> contains references to profiles, tags and security
labels that control the behaviour of the resource. These rules apply to these meta-attributes:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td><b>Interaction</b></td><td><b>Meta-Attribute Actions</b></td></tr>
 <tr><td>read/vread</td><td>The server returns the items in the meta element</td></tr>
 <tr><td>create</td><td>The server stores the items provided with the resource, and may add it's own or edit them for it's own reasons</td></tr>
 <tr><td>update</td><td>The server merges the items provided with the resource along with those already associated with the resource, and may add it's own or edit them for it's own reasons</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
These items are allowed to change without changing the version of the resource
(note: none of the other contents of a resource are allowed to change without changing
the version of the resource). In particular, it must be possible to update the security
labels on old version of a resource. To support this, this operation provides several
interactions that operate directly on the meta element:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td width="50%"><b>HTTP Command</b></td><td valign="center"><b>description</b></td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre>GET [base]/_meta</pre></td><td valign="center">get a list of all profiles, security labels, and tags used in the system</td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre>GET [base]/[type]/_meta</pre></td><td valign="center">get a list of all profiles, security labels, and tags used for the nominated resource type</td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre>GET [base]/[type]/[id]/_meta</pre></td><td valign="center">get a list of all profiles, security labels, and tags affixed to the nominated resource. This is the same information included when reading the resource, but may have different security clearance</td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre>GET [base]/[type]/[id]/_history/[vid]/_meta</pre></td><td valign="center">get a list of all profiles, security labels, and tags affixed  to the nominated version of the resource. This is the same information included when reading the given version of the resource, but may have different security clearance</td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre>POST [base]/[type]/[id]/_meta</pre></td><td valign="center">Affix the provided profiles, security labels, and tags in the list to the nominated resource</td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre>POST [base]/[type]/[id]/_history/[vid]/meta</pre></td><td valign="center">Affix the provided profiles, security labels, and tags in the list to the nominated version of the resource</td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre>POST [base]/[type]/[id]/_meta-delete</pre></td><td valign="center">Remove all profiles, security labels, and tags in the provided list from the meta for the nominated resource</td></tr>
 <tr><td><pre>POST [base]/[type]/[id]/_history/[vid]/_meta-delete</pre></td><td valign="center">Remove all profiles, security labels, and tags in the provided list from the list of tags for the nominated version of the resource</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In all these operations, versionId is not used. The server may choose to populate the lastUpdated. Note that these interactions do not create a new version of the resource.
These interactions use the meta element directly:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;meta xmlns=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir&quot;&gt;
  &lt;profile value=&quot;http://example-consortium.org/fhir/profile/patient&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;security&gt;
    &lt;system value=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;code value=&quot;EMP&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/security&gt;
  &lt;tag&gt;
    &lt;system value=&quot;http://example.com/codes/workflow&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;code value=&quot;needs-review&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/tag&gt;
&lt;/meta&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Or, in JSON:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="json linecounter">
{
  "resourceType" : "meta",
  "profile" : ["http://example-consortium.org/fhir/profile/patient"],
  "security" : [{
    "system" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode",
    "code" : "EMP"
  }],
  "tag" : [{
    "system" : "http://example.com/codes/workflow",
    "code" : "needs-review"
  }]
}
</pre>
</div>

<a name="transactional-integrity"> </a>
<h3>Transactional Integrity</h3>
<p>
When processing <a href="#create">create</a> and <a href="#update">update</a>
operations, a FHIR server is not obliged to accept the entire resource as it
is; when the resource is retrieved through a <a href="#read">read</a> operation
subsequently, the resource may be different. The difference may arise for
several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The server merged updated content with existing content</li>
 <li>The server applied business rules and altered the content</li>
 <li>The server does not fully support all the features or possible values of the resource</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that there is no general purpose method to make merging with existing content or
altering the content by business rules safe or predictable - what is possible,
safe and/or required is highly context dependent. These kind of behaviors may
be driven by security considerations. With regard to incomplete support, Clients can consult the server's
base conformance statement profile references to determine which features or
values the server does not support.
</p>
<p>
To the degree that the server alters the resource for any of
the 3 reasons above, the FHIR server will create implementation
consequences for the eco-system that it is part of, which will
need to be managed (i.e. it will cost more). For this reason,
servers SHOULD change the resource as little as possible.
However due to the variability that exists within healthcare,
this specification allows that servers MAY alter the resource on
create/update.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, to the degree that an implementation context makes special
rules about merging content or altering the content, that context will
become more expensive to maintain.
</p>
<p>
Although these rules are stated with regard to servers, a similar
concept applies to clients - to the degree that different client
systems interacting with the server do not support the same feature
set, the clients and/or the server will be forced to implement custom
logic to prevent information from being lost or corrupted.
</p>
<p>
Some of these problems can be mitigated by following a pattern
built on top of version-aware updates. In this pattern:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The server provides a <a href="#read">read</a> operation for any resource it accepts <a href="#update">update</a> operations on</li>
 <li>Before updating, the client <a href="#read">reads</a> the latest version of the resource</li>
 <li>The client applies the changes it wants to the resource, leaving other information intact (note the <a href="extensibility.html#exchange">extension related rules</a> around this)</li>
 <li>The client writes the result back as an <a href="#update">update</a> operation, and is able to handle a 409 or 412 response (usually by trying again)</li>
</ul>
<p>
If clients follow this pattern, then information from other systems
that they do not understand will be maintained through the update.
</p>
<p>
Note that it's possible for a server to choose to maintain the
information that would be lost, but there is no defined way for
a server to determine whether the client omitted the information
because it wasn't supported (perhaps in this case) or whether it
wishes to delete the information.
</p>
<h4>Conformance</h4>
<p>
Both client and server systems SHOULD clearly document how transaction
integrity is handled.
</p>
<p>
DSTU TODO: how?
</p>



<a name="paging"> </a>
<h3>Paging</h3>
<p>
If servers provide paging for the results of a <a href="#search">search</a> or <a href="#history">history</a> interaction,
they SHALL conform to this method (adapted from <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005">RFC 5005 (Feed
Paging and Archiving)</a> for sending continuation links to the client when returning a <a href="bundle.html">Bundle</a>
(e.g. with history and search). If the server does not do this, there is no way to continue paging.
</p>
<p>
This example shows the third page of a search result:
</p>

<pre class="xml">
&lt;Bundle xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir"&gt;
  &lt;!-- snip metadata --&gt;
  &lt;!-- This Search. url starts with base search, and adds the effective
    parameters, and additional parameters for search state. All searches
    SHALL return this value.

	  In this case, the search continuation method is that the server
    maintains a state, with page references into the stateful list.
	--&gt;
  &lt;link&gt;
    &lt;relation value=&quot;self&quot;&gt;
    &lt;url value=&quot;http://example.org/Patient?name=peter&amp;stateid=23&amp;page=3&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/link&gt;
  &lt;!-- 4 links for navigation in the search. All of these are optional, but recommended --&gt;

  &lt;link&gt;
    &lt;relation value=&quot;first&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;url value=&quot;http://example.org/Patient?name=peter&amp;stateid=23&amp;page=1&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/link&gt;
  &lt;link&gt;
    &lt;relation value=&quot;previous&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;url value=&quot;http://example.org/Patient?name=peter&amp;stateid=23&amp;page=2&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/link&gt;
  &lt;link&gt;
    &lt;relation value=&quot;next&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;url value=&quot;http://example.org/Patient?name=peter&amp;stateid=23&amp;page=4&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/link&gt;
  &lt;link&gt;
    &lt;relation value=&quot;last&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;url value=&quot;http://example.org/Patient?name=peter&amp;stateid=23&amp;page=26&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/link&gt;

  &lt;!-- then the search results... --&gt;
&lt;/Bundle&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The server need not use a stateful paging method as shown in this example - it is at
the discretion of the server how to best ensure that the continuation retains
integrity in the context of ongoing changes to the resources. An alternative approach
is to use version specific references to the records on the boundaries, but this is
subject to continuity failures when records are updated.
</p>
<p>
A server MAY inform the client of the total number of resources returned by the interaction for which the results are paged
using  the <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.total">Bundle.total</a>.
</p>
<p>Note that for search, where _include can be used to return additional related resources, the total number
of resources in the feed may exceed the number indicated in totalResults.</p>

<h3>Intermediaries</h3>
<p>
The HTTP protocol may be routed through an HTTP proxy such as
squid. Such proxies are transparent to the applications, though
implementers should be alert to the effects of caching, particularly
including the risk of receiving stale content. See the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#page-74">HTTP specification</a>
for further detail
</p>
<p>
Interface engines may also be placed between the consumer and
the provider. These differ from proxies because they actively
alter the content and/or destination of the HTTP exchange and are
not bound the rules that apply to HTTP proxies. Such agents are allowed,
but SHALL mark the http header to assist with troubleshooting.
</p>
<p>
Any agent that modifies an HTTP request or Response content other
than under the rules for HTTP proxies SHALL add a stamp to the HTTP
headers like this:
</p>
<pre>
  request-modified-[identity]: [purpose]
  response-modified-[identity]: [purpose]
</pre>
<p>
The identity SHALL be a single token defined by the administrator of the agent
that will sufficiently identify the agent in the context of use. The header
SHALL specify the agent's purpose in modifying the content. End point systems SHALL
not use this header for any purpose. Its aim is to assist with
system troubleshooting.
</p>

<h3>OMG hData RESTful Transport</h3>

<p>
This RESTful specification described here is based on the <a href="http://www.omg.org">OMG Health RESTful specification</a> (specific reference to be provided when this is published).
In this regard, FHIR functions as a Record Format Profile as described in that specification. Note the following significant factors to be aware of:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>FHIR maps the hData sections to resource types, and hData documents to resource instances. There are no subsections, and client systems are not able to create new sections, though <a href="extras.html#compartments">compartments</a> behave somewhat like sections</li>
 <li>Because clients cannot submit new sections (POST to service URL), POST to the service URL has been re-used for <a href="#transaction">the transaction interaction</a> (difference under review)</li>
 <li>FHIR does not (yet) define a root document. When defined, it will contain information about what the FHIR server has done (as opposed to a conformance statement, which describes what it is capable of doing)</li>
 <li>Note that this specification does not repeat the rules in the hData RESTful Transport concerning the OPTIONS command on the service URL, but these rules (extra headers etc.) still apply</li>
