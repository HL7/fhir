<h3>Mixing Characteristics and Members</h3>

<p>
If both <code>Group.characteristic</code> and <code>Group.member</code> are present, then the 
members are the individuals who were found who met the characteristic.  It's possible that 
there might be other candidate members who meet the characteristic and aren't (yet) in the list.  
All members SHALL have the listed characteristics.

<h3>Membership</h3>
<p>
Membership testing is used to test for <b>active</b> members of a Group.  At a minimum,
servers supporting membership testing on Group resources SHALL be able to correctly
identify active enumerated entities.  Active enumerated entities in a group are entities:
<ul>
  <li>listed in <code>Group.member.entity</code>,</li>
  <li>that do not have <code>Group.member.inactive</code> with a value of <code>true</code>, and</li>
  <li>do not have an expired <code>Group.member.period</code> (e.g., either the element is not present or has a period covering 'now').</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Membership testing MAY also be applied to characteristic-defined Groups.  If supported,
membership testing is based on the characteristic testing of the Group.  Any entity meeting
the required characteristics is considered to be <code>active</code>.
</p>
<p>
Servers SHOULD declare whether they support only the enumerated or characteristic group filters.  
Servers MAY impose additional membership constraints (e.g. based on modifier extensions).
