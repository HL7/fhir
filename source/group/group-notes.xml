<h3>Mixing Characteristics and Members</h3>

<p>
If both <code>Group.characteristic</code> and <code>Group.member</code> are present, then the 
members are the individuals who were found who met the characteristic.  It's possible that 
there might be other candidate members who meet the characteristic and aren't (yet) in the list.  
All members SHALL have the listed characteristics.

<h3>Membership</h3>
<p>
Membership testing is used to test for <b>active</b> members of a Group.  At a minimum,
servers supporting membership testing on Group resources SHALL be able to correctly
identify active enumerated entities.  Active enumerated entities in a group are entities:
<ul>
  <li>listed in <code>Group.member.entity</code>,</li>
  <li>that do not have <code>Group.member.inactive</code> with a value of <code>true</code>, and</li>
  <li>do not have an expired <code>Group.member.period</code> (e.g., either the element is not present or has a period covering 'now').</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Membership testing MAY also be applied to characteristic-defined Groups.  If supported,
membership testing is based on the characteristic testing of the Group.  Any entity meeting
the required characteristics is considered to be <code>active</code>.
</p>
<p>
Servers SHOULD declare whether they support only the enumerated or characteristic group filters,
via CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.documentation in markdown.   
Servers MAY impose additional membership constraints (e.g. based on modifier extensions).

<h3>Relationships inside the group</h3>

<p>Some systems may track detailed family relationship codes (e.g. child, mother, grandfather) within a group 
rather than merely saying "family member".  There are a few options to support conveying such information:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Instances of the PersonalRelationship resource can be used to indicate relationships between group members. 
   Such relationships can be leveraged independent of the participants' involvement of the group</li>
 <li>More detailed family relationship codes (e.g. from the [Personal Relationship RoleType Valueset](https://terminology.hl7.org/6.0.2/ValueSet-v3-PersonalRelationshipRoleType.html)) 
   MAY be sent as additional Codings in the <code>Group.member.involvement</code> element.  These SHOULD also be accompanied by the 'family-member' code to support systems that might not understand more detailed codes.  If 
   this is done, then the relationship codes are interpreted as being with respect to whichever group member is designated as "head of household"/"primary contact".  If there is no 
   such group member explicitly designated, then the nature of the more detailed personal relationship codes cannot reliably be interpreted.
