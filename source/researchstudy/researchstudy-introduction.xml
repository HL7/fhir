<b>Ballot Questions:</b>
In terms of scope and usage, the BR&amp;R workgroup wish to
draw the attention of reviewers and implementers to the following topics:
</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The resource has been refined and revised to remove duplication in few areas. We are seeking input from the community on the appropriateness of these changes.</li>
				<li>One major topic that the WG has discussed is the scope of this resource. One proposal under consideration is that the ResearchStudy resource would be a base resource that supports all kinds of research. Use case specific profiles would be developed in the near future to support a) Regulated Clinical Trial Profile, b) Basic Research Study Profile, etc. Below is an illustration of the proposal under consideration.<br/>
				<img src="researchstudy-profile-proposal.png" alt="Image showing the relationship between resources representing people" width="584px" />
				</li>
				<li>WG seeks input in how research study sites should be represented in FHIR. There are two proposals under consideration. Option 1: Develop a ResearchStudySite Profile of ResearchStudy resource, Option 2: Develop a NEW FHIR resource called ResearchStudySite. For now, the WG is doing analysis to see if the profile option (Option 1) would work. All input is welcome.</li>

<p>This resource is a <a href="workflow.html#definition">
        <em>definition resource</em>
      </a> from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a>.</p>
    <p>A process where a researcher or organization plans and then executes a series of steps intended to increase the field of healthcare-related knowledge. This includes studies of safety, efficacy, comparative effectiveness and other information about medications, devices, therapies and other interventional and investigative techniques. A ResearchStudy involves the gathering of information about human or animal subjects or stability data about drug products or drug substances.</p>
	<p>For clinical trials -- A research study is a scientific way to improve or develop new methods of health care. Studies are designed to answer specific questions on how to prevent, diagnose, or treat diseases and disorders. The ResearchStudy resource describes essential information about the study, including the purpose, objective, sponsor, investigator, therapy, condition being studied, schedule of activities, and other key items.</p>
    <p>Uses for the ResearchStudy resource include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Registering a clinical trial in trial registry such as clinicaltrials.gov</li>
      <li>Communicating study protocol information between study stakeholders</li>
      <li>Supporting study set up of sites, forms</li>
      <li>Grouping Observation resources by study</li>
      <li>Setting up a Schedule of Activities for the study and its subjects</li>
	  <li>Specifying Study information in support of Genomic, Proteomic and Stability studies</li>
      </ul>

  <h3>Extensions</h3>
  <p>ResearchStudy is aimed at all forms of studies.  For some study types specific extensions have been defined </p>

  <p>
    <b>Extension: SiteRecruitment</b>
  </p>
<p>Some studies need to find sites according to specific criteria - for example site has a freezer capable of very low temperatures and a centrifuge.</p>

  <p>
    <b>Extension: StudyRegistration</b>
  </p>
<p>Used to separate study registration activities from study progress status.</p>
