<h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
<p>
This profile sets expectations for use of the <a href="dataelement.html">DataElement</a> resource within the 
<a href="sdc.html">Structured Data Capture</a> implementation guide.  This includes
identifying which core elements and extensions must be supported.
</p>
<p>
The focus of this profile is on those characteristics of Data Elements which are necessary to support the
definition of forms (questionnaires) that can support auto-population or pre-population of content on the basis
of referenced data elements.
</p>
<p>
For the purposes of this profile, <i>Supported</i> means that clients SHALL be capable of processing the element/extension and use the information to control the display
and information capture associated with the <a href="dataelement.html">DataElement</a>.  It means that servers SHALL be capable of persisting those elements and returning them in response
to requests.

<h3>Boundaries and Relationships</h3>
<p>
This profile relies on the use of a number of other profiles, some required, others available for use "when necessary":
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="dataelement-11179.html">datalement-11179</a> which defines extensions for ISO-11179-specific concepts, such as ObjectClass and Property</li>
  <li><a href="element-extensions.html">element-extensions</a> which defines extensions describing constraints on the values for data elements.  There are used here to constrain the allowed values for questions.</li>
  <li><a href="iso-21090.html">iso-21090</a> provides extensions for strings allowing the conveying of language and translation extensions which may be relevant in some environment</li>
</ul>
