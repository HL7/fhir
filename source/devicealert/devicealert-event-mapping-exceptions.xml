The absence of a category may limit the ability to determine when the element should be handled, so strong consideration should be given to how systems will be able to determine category values for legacy data and how data that cannot be categorized will be handled.  As well, some categories might not be mutually exclusive, so systems should prepare for multiple declared categories - even within a single category 'axis'.&#10;In general, there should not be a 'strong' binding ('required' or 'extensible') on the category element overall.  Instead, the element can be sliced and bindings can be asserted that apply to particular repetitions."/>
