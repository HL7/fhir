<h3>Dealing with duplicate entries</h3>
<p>
In some cases, the same code or identifier system might accidentally get created more than once in a registry (perhaps because someone failed to check
for an existing entry before adding a new one or knows the same concept with a different name.  If this occurs, one of the system entries should be deleted
and the remaining entry should have its information updated to include any identifiers present on the original entry (and possibly have its descriptive 
information modified to include additional information gleaned from the duplicate entry).
