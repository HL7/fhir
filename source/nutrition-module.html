    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The Nutrition module in FHIR provides a structured framework to document and manage consumable food, drinks, and supplements integral to patient care. It captures essential information on nutrition-related items and how they are utilized, whether for therapeutic purposes or routine consumption. Nutrition is key in patient care, from standard diets to more specialized nutrition delivery systems.  For more inforamtion, please see the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=609">HL7 Domain Analysis Model: Nutrition Care, Release 3</a></p>

        The Nutrition module is designed to differentiate between various types of nutritional intake and their relevant documentation: 
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>NutritionIntake:</b> This resource is used to document the intake of foods, drinks, oral nutrition supplements, and other consumables like infant formula or breastmilk. It records patient consumption—whether past, present, or planned—based on inputs from the patient, family members, or healthcare providers. 
        See <a href="https://build.fhir.org/nutritionintake-examples.html">Nutrition Intake Examples</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>NutritionProduct:</b> Focuses on identifying consumable food products, both solid and liquid, intended for human consumption. This includes general food items, beverages, and other nutritional consumables used in patient care settings. 
        See <a href="https://build.fhir.org/nutritionproduct-examples.html">Nutrition Product Examples</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>NutritionOrder:</b> This resource describes various dietary requests made for patients. It includes general oral diets (e.g., General Healthy diet), therapeutic diets (e.g., low-sodium or fluid-restricted diets), oral nutrition supplements, enteral feedings (tube feeding), and infant formulas. 
        See <a href="https://build.fhir.org/nutritionorder-examples.html">Nutrition Order Examples</a>

    <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>

    <a name="usecase-heart-failure-inpatient"></a>
    <b>Heart Failure Inpatient Use Case.</b>
    <ol>
        <li>The dietitian performs a comprehensive nutrition assessment (Observation).</li>
        <li>The dietitian documents the patient's admitted weight (65kg) and nutrition history (ClinicalImpression).
            <ul>
                <li>The assessment reveals the patient adheres to a low sodium diet. The patient reports decreased food intake due to dental issues and prefers foods that are easy to chew. Additionally, the patient is lactose intolerant and adheres to the Halal diet. The patient also reports a dislike of strawberries.</li>
                <li>The dietitian's nutrition diagnoses (Condition) are: Excessive sodium intake related to intake of processed foods at home as evidenced by food recall. Excessive fluid intake related to new recommendation to restrict fluid intake as evidenced by client statements of intake of ~2.4 liters of fluid/day.</li>
                <li>The dietitian's nutrition intervention care plan is to recommend a diet that includes 2gm sodium, 1500ml fluid restriction, mechanically altered, lactose-free, and Halal.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The physician reviews the dietitian's recommendations.</li>
        <li>The physician enters a <a href="nutritionorder.html">comprehensive diet order</a> into the Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) system. The order includes:
            <ul>
                <li>2gm sodium</li>
                <li>1500ml fluid restriction</li>
                <li>Mechanically altered</li>

        <li>The dietitian schedules nutrition monitoring and evaluation of the patient's acceptance of foods consistent with NutritionOrder as well as goal of less lower extremity edema and shortness of breath.</li>
    </ol>

    <a name="usecase-ambulatory-outpatient"></a>
    <b>Outpatient/Ambulatory Use Case.</b>
    <ol>
        <li>The dietitian performs a comprehensive nutrition assessment (Observation). A 52-year-old male was seen in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) clinic regarding placement of a gastrostomy tube (GT) as they have been losing weight and respiratory status is worsening making it difficult for the patient to take medications, to eat, and to maintain weight.
            <ul>
                <li>In the multi-disciplinary office visit including the speech therapist and dietitian, the dietitian identified the patient's nutritional status to be moderate malnutrition (<strong>Observation</strong>). Speech therapy noted that the patient requires IDDSI minced and moist level 5 foods and IDDSI mildly thick level 2 drinks. Due to the patient's inadequate oral intake meeting &lt; 50% of needs and weight loss, the dietitian also recommended placement of GT with 750 mLs of a high protein enteral nutrition feeding via an evening bolus to provide 750 kcals and 45 gm protein.</li>
                <li>Nutrition education was provided pre-op during the multi-disciplinary office visit.</li>
                <li>Indication for G-tube is: Dysphagia, increased work of breathing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The dietitian's nutrition diagnosis (Condition) is moderate chronic disease or condition related malnutrition related to dysphagia and increased work of breathing as evidenced by unintended weight loss of 7 % in the past 3 months, moderate temporalis muscle atrophy, and moderate Interosseous hand muscle atrophy.</li>
        <li>Based on the documented (ClinicalImpression) assessment and nutrition diagnosis, the <a href="careplan.html">nutrition intervention care plan</a> includes:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="nutritionorder.html">Nutrition Order</a>: International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Framework (IDDSI) minced and moist level 5 foods and IDDSI mildly thick level 2 drinks. Also, GT placement to supplement oral intake with 750 mLs of a high protein enteral nutrition formula via an evening bolus via gastrostomy tube to provide 750 kcals and 45 gm protein.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>After reviewing the multidisciplinary team's note, the physician entered orders for insertion of a gastrostomy feeding tube. The physician also entered <a href="nutritionorder.html">post-op nutrition orders</a> by selecting from the available diet and enteral nutrition codes in the CPOE system:
            <ul>
                <li>Diet: International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Framework - Minced and moist Level 5 foods</li>
                <li>International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Framework - Mildly Thick Level 2 drinks</li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <strong>NutritionOrder</strong> is transmitted to the Durable Medical Equipment (DME) supplier (tube feed &amp; tube feedinb supplies) &amp; home care agency.</li>
        <li>The enteral home care company provides enteral feeding supplies and instructions for the patient and caregivers at home based on the referral from the ALS clinic physician.</li>
        <li>The patient will follow-up with speech therapy and dietitian at the next multidisciplinary clinic visit for speech and nutrition monitoring and evaluation of the care plan with revisions as needed.</li>
