<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The Coverage resource is intended to provide the high level identifiers and potentially descriptors of an insurance plan which may used to pay for,
 in part or in whole, the provision of health care products and services. 
</p>
<p>
This resource may also be used to register 'SelfPay' where an individual or organization other than an insurer is taking responsibility for payment for a
 portion of the health care costs.
