The security even is based on the ATNA Audit record definitions, originally from <a href="http://www.rfc3881.net">RFC 3881</a>, and now managed by
DICOM (see <a href="http://medical.nema.org/Dicom/2011/11_15pu.pdf">DICOM Part 15</a>). This resource is managed collaboratively between HL7, DICOM,
and IHE for the MHD/mHealth initiatives. 
</p>
<p>
Servers that provide support for Security Event resources should not generally accept update or delete operations on the resources, as this would compromise the integrity of the audit record.
