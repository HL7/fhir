<p>
This is a draft for what an ATNA Audit Record (<a href="http://www.rfc3881.net">RFC 3881</a>) might look like if provided as a FHIR resource. 
This is work in progress performed collaboratively between HL7 and IHE for the MHD/mHealth initiatives. Neither HL7 nor IHE is committed to 
pursuing this path - it is simply being evaluated as a possibility.
</p>
<p>
Things to note about the current design:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In this resource, the Participant Object Detail from <a href="http://www.rfc3881.net">RFC 3881</a> is handled as standard FHIR extensions to the <i>object</i> element</li>
</ul>

<p>
Servers that provide support for Security Event resources should not accept update or delete operations on the resources.
