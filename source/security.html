<h1>FHIR Security</h1>

<p>
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is not a security protocol, nor does it define any security
related functionality. However FHIR does define exchange protocols and content models that need to be used
with various security protocols defined elsewhere. This section gathers all information about security
in one section. A summary:
</p>
<ul class="dense">
 <li>Communications Security - all exchange of production data should be secured using TLS/SSL (e.g. https)</li>
 <li>Authentication - Users/Clients may be authenticated in any way desired. For web-centric use, OAuth is recommended</li>
 <li>Authorization/Access Control - FHIR defines a Security Label infrastructure to support access control management. FHIR may also define a set of resources to administer access control management, but does not do so at present</li>
 <li>Audit - FHIR defines <a href="provenance.html">provenance</a> and <a href="securityevent.html">security event</a> resources suitable for tracking the origins, authorship, history, status and access of resources</li>
 <li>Digital Signatures - FHIR includes several specifically reserved locations for digital signatures</li>
 <li>Attachments - FHIR allows for binary resources and attachments. These have their own concerns</li>
</ul>
<p>
Time critical concerns regarding security flaws in the FHIR specification should be addressed to 
the <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_email_list_subscription_instructions">FHIR email 
list</a> for prompt consideration. Alternatively, issues can be raised through the 
<a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Security_Page">community input</a> mechanism.
</p>

<p>
Implementers should track the developing IHE IUA Profile for additional security considerations.
</p>

<p>
A production FHIR system will need some kind of security sub-system that administers 
users, user authentication and user-authorization. Where this sub-system fits into the 
deployment architecture is a matter for system design:
</p>
<table class="dense">
 <tr>
  <td valign="center">
 <img  height="263" width="358" src="security-layout.png"/>
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="center" style="border-left: 1px solid grey">
<table class="dense">
 <tr><td><img height="32" width="32" src="security-icon-user.png"/></td><td>The consumer that is using a healthcare related system</td></tr>
 <tr><td><img height="32" width="32" src="security-icon-app.png"/></td><td>The client application the user is using (application, mobile app, website, etc.)</td></tr>
 <tr><td><img height="32" width="32" src="security-icon-sec.png"/></td><td>The security system that authenticates and authorizes the user</td></tr>
 <tr><td><img height="32" width="32" src="security-icon-fhir.png"/></td><td>The clinical/healthcare repository</td></tr>
</table>
</td></tr></table>

<p>
In this diagram, the red lines represent FHIR interfaces. From the perspective of the FHIR API, 
the client (consumer of FHIR services) may either interact with a security system that manifests
as a FHIR server, and which depends on a subsequent FHIR interface to provide the actual storage,
or either the client or server interacts with the security system independently. In each of these
3 scenarios, the different components may be assembled into applications or network components
differently, but the same logical layout applies. 
</p>
<p>
The FHIR specification assumes that a security system exists, and that it may be deployed 
in front of or behind the FHIR API. Because there are a plethora of standards relating to 
the administration and functionality of the security system, FHIR does not provide user,
profile, or other such administration resources. Instead, the FHIR resources are the targets
of the policies expressed in these other approaches. What FHIR does specify is a way to apply
security labels to resources so that a security system may use these (along with the contents
of the resources if appropriate) to determine whether a user is authorised to perform a 
particular FHIR operation or not.

<!--
These HTTP calls may be authenticated against a single user account (including 
using <a href="http://www.oauth.org">OAuth</a>), but this arrangement doesn't cater for common transaction metadata such as multiple users, 
responsible party, reasons, consents, etc. that are commonly encountered in healthcare. Instead, 
use of this RESTful implementation assumes that appropriate security and logs are managed by the client (perhaps 
through using <a href="http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Audit_Trail_and_Node_Authentication">ATNA</a>), and 
that the server trusts the client to maintain these. One implication is that this RESTful framework is 
only suitable for use where such trust relationships exist (e.g. in a single institution) and is not 
suitable where such trust does not exist (e.g. state &amp; national EHR systems and health record 
systems that support disparate systems). Similarly, this simple RESTful interface has no support for 
explicit archiving and similar functions. Use-cases where these kind of features are required should 
consider a <a href="message.html">messaging</a> or <a href="implementation.html#SOA">SOA-based approach</a> or 
some other kind of profiled REST interface.

<h2>
Communications
</h2>
<p>
For the <a href="http.html">RESTful API</a>, normal HTTP security rules apply. 
The <a href="http.html#root">Service Root URL</a> will specify whether SSL is required. 
Client authentication may be required by the server, possibly including the requirement for 
client certificates.
</p>
<p>
SSL SHOULD be used for all production data exchange.
</p>
<p>
To support browser-based client applications, recommend that servers SHOULD implement <a href="http://enable-cors.org/">cross-origin resource sharing</a> for the <a href="http.html">REST operations</a>.  
</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>
<p>
Other than testing systems, FHIR servers should authenticate the clients. 
The server may choose to authenticate the client system and trust it, or to authenticate
the individual user by a variety of techniques. For web-centric use, 
<a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> may be used to authenticate and/or authorise 
the users. 
</p>

<!-- note about using OAuth and delegating user authority -->

<h2>
Authorization/Access Control
</h2>


<p>
Correctly identifying people, devices, locations and organizations is one of the foundations that any security system is built on. 
Most uses of security protocols, whether authentication, access control, digital signatures, etc. rely on the correct mapping between
the relevant resources and the underlying systems. Note that this isn't necessary: there is nothing in FHIR that requires or relies 
on any security being in place, or any particular implementation. But real world usage will generally require this. 
</p>
<p>

Todo.. outline general considerations. Note: this is under active investigation through connectathons running 
parallel to the ballot process, and further work is expected on this section. Interested parties should track 
the joint security / FHIR work in this area.

<h2>
Digital Signatures
</h2>
<p>This specification recommends the use of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/">W3C Digital Signatures</a> to sign resources and  
provides an element in the <a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a> resource to carry 
a detached digital signature for a resource. This does not prohibit other ways of using digital signatures.</p>

<p>
Additional work is anticipated in this area, including alignment with the <a href="http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Document_Digital_Signature">IHE DSG profile</a>.
</p>


<h2>Attachments</h2>
<p>
Several FHIR resources include attachments. Attachments can either be references to content found elsewhere, or included inline encoded in base64.
Attachments represent security risks in a way that FHIR resources do not, since some attachments contain executable code. Implementers should 
always use caution when handling resources.
