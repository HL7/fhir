<b>Questions</b>

<ul>
    <li>Should there be a separate entry for duration? Currently this is inferred from date if represented as a Period</li>
    <li>Indication is currently a string. What to do if you want to indicate that the procedure is because of a Condition?
    You could use relatedItem, but is it confusing to have indication in multiple places.</li>
    <li>Should we support a careplan as followup?</li>
</ul>
