It might also be accompanied by body site information or time information (i.e. no procedure was done to the left arm or no procedure was done in this 2-year period).  Specifying additional information such as performer, outcome, etc. is generally inappropriate.  For example, it\'s not that useful to say \"There was no appendectomy done at 12:03pm June 6th by Dr. Smith with a successful outcome\" as it implies that there *could* have been an appendectomy done at any other time, by any other clinician or with any other outcome.\n\nThis element is labeled as a modifier because it indicates that a procedure didn\'t happen
