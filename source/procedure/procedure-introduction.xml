<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
This resource is used to record the details of procedures performed on a patient. A procedure is an activity 
that is performed with or on a patient as part of the provision of care. Examples include  surgical 
procedures, diagnostic procedures, endoscopic procedures, biopsies, and exclude things for which 
there are specific resources, such as immunizations, drug administrations. 
</p>
<p>
Note that many diagnostic processes are procedures that generate observations and reports. In many cases, 
the existence of the procedure is assumed, but where there are details of interest about how the 
diagnostic procedure was performed, the procedure resource is used to describe the activity.
