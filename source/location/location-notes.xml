<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Multiple Organizations or Practitioners may provide services at a Location. These references are not kept in Location, but can be found
in the models for <a href="organization.html">Organization</a> and <a href="practitioner.html">Practitioner</a> instead.</li>
<li>Locations may range from whole buildings to cabinets; it is possible to relate smaller Locations to their containing bigger Location 
using the Location.partOf element.</li>
<li>Location.position is expressed using the same syntax, datum and reference system as used in Google Earth's KML files,
see <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml">Google/OGS's KML</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Location Mode</h3>
<p>The Location.mode element can be used to indicate whether a Location resource represents a specific (potentially identifiable) Location ('instance'), 
or a class of Locations ('kind'). Especially Resources capturing orders, resource scheduling, plans and definitions may refer to Locations in 'kind' mode. 
For these domains, it is often not necessary to refer to a specific Location, but rather to a class of Locations. An example of this is found in planning, 
where we need to allocate an "isolation room" for a patient, or need to dispatch "an ambulance" at a certain time. In these cases it is not important 
exactly which isolation room or ambulance is allocated, and it is sufficient to just indicate a 'kind' of Location.</p>
<p>Note that 'kind' should not be used to represent Locations where an actual instance of a Location was involved, but identifying information is missing.
E.g. when a patient arrived 'by ambulance', but it is not known by which ambulance, this should be represented using a Location in 'instance' mode with a
missing identifier, not a Location of 'kind' ambulance.</p>
<p>
Some of Location's data elements are only relevant when mode is 'instance' and should not be used when mode is 'kind':<br/>
	<i>(however this information could still be included if was relevant, such as when it is a generic item, but not globally generic, e.g. a Burgers MU ambulance)</i>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Location.identifier</li>
<li>Location.telecom</li>
<li>Location.address</li>
<li>Location.position</li>
<li>Location.status</li>
<li>Location.managingOrganization</li>
</ul>

	<h2>Example Location Hierarchy</h2>
	<p>
		An example location hierarchy should help give some guidance as to one example
		of how a location hierarchy could look within a fictitious Hospital.<br/>
		<i>(The nesting here would be the "part-of" structure of the location)</i>
	</p>
	<pre>
Hospital A Building C (instance)
    East Wing (instance)
        Level 1 (instance)
            Reception (instance)
            Nurses Station EM-ns1 (instance)
                Medication Cupboard A (instance)
            Room 1 (instance)
                Room 1a (instance) - space in room separatable via a curtain
                    Bed 1a (instance) - always in this room
                Room 1b (instance)
                    Trolley 43 (instance) - moves about
                Room 1d (instance)
                    Trolley 19 (instance) - moves about
                Room 2 (instance)
                    ...
            Theatre EM-TA (instance)
            Coridor (generic)
        Level 2 (instance)
            Reception (instance)
                ...
            Nurses Station EM-ns1 (instance)
                Medication Cupboard A (instance)
            Coridor (generic)
Mobile Services (kind)
    Ambulance (kind)
        Ambulance AMB1 (instance)
        Ambulance AMB2 (instance)
	</pre>
	<p>
		<i>Note: Wards/departments are not part of this structure - these would form part of the Organizational Hierarchy.</i>

    <h3>Positional Searching</h3>
    <p>
        Searching for locations often require that a facility is within a specified distance of a particilar point.
        For example, to locate healthcare facilities within 2kms of a clients home, or the current geo-coded
        position of a practitioner travelling between patients (read from a mobile phone or device).
    </p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/Location?near=-83.694810,42.256500&amp;near-distance=11.20||km;...
</pre>
    <p>
        The distance between the location and the provided point is often used as one of the 
        determining factors for selection of the location. So this value is included in the results.<br/>
        However the value cannot be inside the Location resource as it is different depending on the
        point of reference in the search. So the distance between is included in the search section
        of the bundle entry.
    </p>
<pre>
&lt;entry&gt; 
    &lt;resource&gt;
        &lt;Location&gt;
            &lt;!-- location details --&gt;
        &lt;/Location&gt;
    &lt;/resource&gt;
    &lt;search&gt;
        &lt;extension url=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/location-distance&quot;&gt;
            &lt;valueDistance &gt;
                &lt;!-- The distance that this location resource is from the provided point in the query --&lt;
                &lt;/value value=&quot;10.5&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;/unit value=&quot;km&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/valueDistance&gt;
        &lt;/extension&gt;
    &lt;/search&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
