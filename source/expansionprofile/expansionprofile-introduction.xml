<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The purpose of the expansion profile is to allow a client that is using a terminology
service to configure the behaviour of the terminology server in regard to how it 
builds expansions - and, in a similar manner, how it validates codes in value set.
ExpansionProfiles are used for the following operations:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="valueset-operations.html#expand">Value Set Expansion</a></li>
<li><a href="valueset-operations.html#validate-code">Value Set based Validation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The ExpansionProfile can be passed either directly, or as a reference by its canonical URL.
</p>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
The ExpansionProfile is used to configure the behaviour of a terminology server
when it processes <a href="valueset.html">ValueSet</a> resources. As such, there
is a tight relationship between the two resources; ValueSets specify what codes
are in the value set, while ExpansionProfile affect run time behaviour. 
</p>
<p>
ExpansionProfiles do not change what codes are in a defined value set. 
They can never add codes to the value set. They can be used to reduce
the number of codes returned in an expansion, but this is a reduced
view of the value set, not a change in the value set itself. Note, though,
the <a href="#overrides">discussion about overriding versions below</a>.
