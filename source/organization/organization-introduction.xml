<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
This resource may be used in a shared registry of contact and other information for various organizations or it can be used merely as a support
for other resources that need to reference organizations, perhaps as a <a href="documents.html">document</a>, <a href="messaging.html">message</a> or 
as a <a href="references.html#contained">contained</a> resource.  If using a registry approach, it's entirely possible for multiple registries to exist, each dealing
with different types or levels of organization.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
The Organization resource is used for collections of people that have come together to achieve an objective.  
The <a href="group.html">Group</a> resource is used to identify a collection of people (or animals, devices, etc.) 
that are gathered for the purpose of analysis or acting upon, but are not expected to act themselves.
</p>
	<p>
		The Organization resource often exists as a hierarchy of organization resources, using the <i>part-of</i> property to provide
		the association of the child to its parent organization.<br/>
		This organizational hierarchy helps communicate the conceptual structure, whereas the Location resource provides the physical
		representation of the hierarchy.<br/>
		The linkage between Organization and Location is from each point in the location hierarchy to the appropriate level in the 
		Organization hierarchy. These links don't all have to be to the top level Organization.<br/>
		When populating the organization and location hierarchies there is often not a clear distinction between these 2, however
		to assist in making the decision, Locations are always used for recording where a service occurs, and hence where encounters
		and observations are associated. The Organization property on these resources might not be the location where the service took place.
	</p>
	<p>
		As noted in the Event pattern, a Location represents where a service is performed.  An Organization can represent who performed the service.
