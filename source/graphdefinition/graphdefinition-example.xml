  <description value="Specify to include list references when generating a document using the $document operation"/>
  <!-- 
    the $document operation will include everything directly linked to by the composition resource.
    In our case, we want any resources referred to by lists referenced from the composition to 
    be included as well. 
    
    We do this by defining a 'graph' of resources - and then we'll say to the $document server,
    aggregate this graph as well as other resources. So we define a graph that starts at composition,
    goes from section to list, and includes all the resources the list includes. 
    
    While we're at it, we're going to say that all these resources must be about the same patient.
    Note that there are use cases for crossing patient record boundaries in documents, but not *this case*.
