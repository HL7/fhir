<h3>The Standards Development Process</h3>

<p>
FHIR is a standard.  In order to be useful, standards need to evolve.  At the same time, the evolution of standards
needs to be predictable and manageable for the implementation community.  This section describes how HL7
develops a standard so that implementers know what to expect as the standard evolves.
</p>

<p>
HL7 has five descriptive terms that describe the level of stability and implementation readiness associated with
different aspects of the specification.  They are as follows:
</p>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Standard Level</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>This content was approved by the <a href="https://ansi.org">ANSI standards process</a> in a previous version (see <a href="history.html#normative">Normative status note</a>).
        It has been subject to review and production implementation in a wide variety of environments.
        The content is considered to be stable and has been 'locked', subjecting it to FHIR
        <a href="#change">Inter-version Compatibility Rules</a>.  While changes are possible, they are
        expected to be infrequent and are tightly constrained.
        <br/><br/>

        consideration as a normative standard.

      implementers some insight as to functionality likely to be included in future versions of the specification.

<a name="mixed"></a>
<h4>Mixed Normative content</h4>
<p>
Some Normative artifacts contain a few parts labeled as 'Trial Use' <i>even though the artifact itself
is labeled 'Normative'</i>:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Some normative resources contain elements labeled as 'trial-use'</li>
 <li>Some normative pages contain sections labeled as 'trial-use'</li>
</ul>
<p>
While HL7 prefers to avoid this outcome, there are several resources where the overall functionality
of the artifact is clearly ready to be labeled as 'normative' while some very specific parts are known
not to have the requisite level of implementation experience as the rest of the resource.
E.g. <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.signature">Bundle.signature</a>.
</p>
<p>
Where a Normative resource contains elements marked as trial-use, these elements are clearly marked
in the resource definitions. Implementers should be aware that future versions of the FHIR specification
may change these parts of the resources (in addition to the other changes allowed under the
<a href="versions.html#change">inter-version compatibility rules</a>. While HL7 will carefully
consider the consequences of breaking change to these elements, implementers should be aware that
reading/using these elements has the potential to cause breaking change to their applications later.
</p>
<p>
Note that this same status will arise as a matter of process when new elements are introduced into
normative resources in future versions - they will undergo a period of trial use as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
Note: it is also possible that some resources in the future will be labeled as 'trial use', but
contain some elements labeled as 'normative'. There is no resource like this in this specification,
though all Trial Use resources contain normative content from <a href="resource.html">Resource</a>
and <a href="domainresource.html">DomainResource</a>, and the <a href="datatypes.html">Datatypes</a>.
</p>

<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The above statuses can apply to both the standard overall as well as to individual components of the FHIR specification</li>
 <li>All pages in the specification identify their status explicitly. A few pages are Table of contents or other kinds of navigational pages, and are <i>Informative</i></li>
 <li>Some content is labeled with the status "External", which means that the content is maintained in another standard, and the status must be found by consulting that other standard. In this case, the Maturity Model does not apply</li>
 <li>When a shared <a href="searchparameter.html">SearchParameter</a> is marked as normative and is used on a non-normative resource, the SearchParameter definition is considered to be normative and its definition is subject
   to normative inter-version compatibility rules.  However, its use (and path expression) with respect to any trial-use or informative resources it applies to is still considered to be trial-use and subject to change as the associated trial-use resource(s) evolve.
   Non-normative resources that use the search parameter could be dropped and new resources sharing the search parameter can be added.</li>
</ul>

<a name="maturity"></a>
<h3>Maturity Levels</h3>
<p>
The content of this release has been subject to significant review through ballot and other HL7 processes and many aspects of it have been
implemented and subjected to interoperability testing through Connectathons and early adoption.  However, the degree of testing has varied.  Some resources
have been well tested in a variety of environments.  Others have received relatively little real-world exercise.  In general, the infrastructure should be
considered to be more stable than the resources themselves.  In some cases, there are issues on which input is specifically requested during the
<a href="#stu">Trial Use</a> period
(see the <a href="todo.html">Outstanding Issue List</a>, and known issues will arise after publication (refer to the
<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir-issues">FHIR Change Request</a> tracker for details.)
Guidance from early implementation will help address these areas.
</p>

<p>
All artifacts in this specification are assigned a "Maturity Level", known as FMM (after the well-known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model">CMM</a> grades).
The FMM level can be used by implementers to judge how advanced - and therefore stable - an artifact is. The following FMM levels are defined:
</p>
<table class="lines">
 <tr><td>Draft (0)</td><td>the resource or profile (artifact) has been published on the current build.  Draft resources can only have a standards status of <a href="#draft">Draft</a></td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>FMM 1</b></td><td>PLUS the artifact produces no warnings during the build process and the responsible WG has indicated that they consider the artifact substantially complete and ready for implementation. For resources, profiles and implementation guides, the FHIR Management Group has approved the underlying resource/profile/IG proposal</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>FMM 2</b></td><td>PLUS the artifact has been tested and successfully supports interoperability among at least three independently developed systems leveraging most of the scope (e.g. at least 80% of the core data elements) using semi-realistic data and scenarios based on at least one of the declared scopes of the artifact (e.g. at a connectathon). These interoperability results must have been reported to and accepted by the FMG</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>FMM 3</b></td><td>PLUS + the artifact has been verified by the work group as meeting the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Conformance+QA+Criteria">Conformance Resource Quality Guidelines</a>; has been subject to a round of formal balloting; has at least 10 distinct implementer comments recorded in the tracker drawn from at least 3 organizations resulting in at least one substantive change</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>FMM 4</b></td><td>PLUS the artifact has been tested across its scope (see below), published in a formal publication (e.g. <code>Trial-Use</code>), and implemented in multiple prototype projects. As well, the responsible work group agrees the artifact is sufficiently stable to require implementer consultation for subsequent non-backward compatible changes</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>FMM 5</b></td><td> the artifact has been published in two formal publication release cycles at FMM1+ (i.e. Trial-Use level) and has been implemented in at least 5 independent production systems in more than one country</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>Normative</b></td><td>the artifact is now considered stable</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Tested across scope means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FMG">FMG</a> has signed off on the list of "example contexts" defined for the artifact</li>
  <li>For each example context, the artifact has either been: reviewed and approved by a domain expert for that scope area, mapped to an existing implemented scope-area-specific standard or tested in an implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Maturity level is strongly related to stability; the higher the maturity level, the more controls are enforced to restrict breaking changes to the resource.
For further information, and discussion, see the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Maturity+Model">FHIR Confluence page</a>.
</p>
<p>
The maturity model is significantly influenced by the degree and type of implementation activity using an artifact.
For this reason, we encourage implementers to <a href="http://fhir.org/implementations/usage">register their implementations</a>.
A detailed analysis of the basis for the maturity metrics for FHIR artifacts can be found <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/maturity-metrics">here</a>.
</p>


<a name="versions"></a>
<h3>FHIR Releases and Versioning</h3>

<p>
New versions of FHIR will be published on a release cycle of approximately 18-24 months.  This frequency is based on
the timelines necessary to consult with implementers, to develop and review new content, as well as to undertake the
formal balloting and reconciliation processes required for ANSI-approved standards.  This release cycle also ensures
an opportunity to incorporate implementer feedback from earlier versions of the specification into subsequent versions.
Limited-scope releases on a shorter timeline may occur occasionally where necessary to meet implementer needs.
</p>
<p>
Each new release is assigned a unique version number. The FHIR version policy is based on
<a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic versioning</a>, but with some differences due to the
fact that FHIR is a specification, not a software API.
</p>
<p>
There is a single development version of FHIR. This undergoes cycles of development as
managed by HL7. Each major cycle of development is concluded by a formal ballot (or more than one),
and then a new specification is published. In version control terms, each published specification
is a branch off the development trunk, which may then itself undergo further change as
HL7 maintains the published specification (though such changes are usually
minimal, limited to necessary technical corrections or security alerts).
</p>

<p>
Each FHIR version is identified by a string composed from 4 parts: major.minor.patch-label.
</p>
<table class="lines">
  <tr>
   <td valign="top">major</td>
   <td>
     <ul>

       <li>The first <i>Trial Use</i> was version 0</li>
       <li>FHIR Release 2 (DSTU) was version 1</li>
       <li>FHIR Release 3 (STU) was version 3 (skipped '2' to align the major numbers at implementer request)</li>
       <li>FHIR Release 4 (Normative + STU) is version 4</li>
       <li>FHIR Release 5 (STU) is version 5</li>
     </ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td valign="top">minor</td>
   <td>
     <ul>
       <li>An update that includes minor substantive changes (potentially including limited breaking changes)</li>
       <li>NOTE - this allowance for breaking changes differs from traditional <a href="http://semver.org/">SEMVER</a> practice</li>
       <li>When a new publication is made, this is reset to 0 in the publication, and 1 in the development branch</li>
       <li>Since HL7 does not make breaking changes as technical corrections to a published specification, these versions of FHIR always have a version number X.n.0</li>
       <li>Because the development version is the subject of ongoing analysis, debate, ballot and repeated alterations, breaking changes are to be expected in STU content</li>
       <li>FHIR Release 4B (STU changes only) is version 4.3.0</li>
     </ul>

       <li>E.g. 4.0.1 represents the first technical correction on the 4.0.0 release</li>
     </ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td valign="top">label</td>
   <td>
     <ul>
       <li>A tag at the end of a release represents a 'working' version of the specification that is building up to the specified release number; e.g. 5.0.0-ballot1, 5.0.0-snapshot3, etc.</li>
       <li>The content preceding the label indicates the 'intended' release number that will result at the conclusion of ballot, review, etc.</li>
       <li>label can be any string, however typical labels will be:
         <ul>
           <li>"snapshotN" - a frozen release of a specification for connectathon, ballot dependencies or other reasons</li>
           <li>"ballotN" - a frozen release used in the ballot process</li>
           <li>"draftN" - a frozen release put out for non-ballot review or QA.</li>
           <li>"cibuild" - a 'special' release label that refers to a non-stable release that changes with each commit.</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>Each label is sortable relative to other versions with the same label base (e.g., snapshot &lt; snapshot2), but there is no sortable relationship defined between different labels</li>
     </ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Additional notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Changes to a formally published specification (except for minor publishing corrections, such as correcting broken external links) are only made via announced technical corrections</li>
 <li>The reference implementations have 2 versions - the version of the specification that they implement and their own version. Consult the reference implementation documentation for policy regarding this version number</li>
</ul>


<a name="version-identification"></a>
<h3>Version identification</h3>
<p>
The FHIR version is usually known implicitly, but can be specified/determined by one of three methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.fhirVersion">fhirVersion</a> element in the
   applicable <a href="capabilitystatement-definitions.html">CapabilityStatement</a>, <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a>,
    or <a href="implementationguide.html">ImplementationGuide</a></li>
<li>The <a href="http.html#version-parameter">fhirVersion parameter</a> on the MIME-type that applies to the resource</li>
<li>Specifying a version specific profile on the resource itself in <a href="resource.html#Meta">Resource.meta</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
For further information, see <a href="versioning.html">Managing Multiple FHIR Versions</a>.
</p>

<a name="change"></a>
<h3>Rules for Inter-version change</h3>
[%dragons-start%]
<p>
The intent of these rules is to ensure that applications that are conformant to an existing
specification are also conformant to subsequent versions. In practice, there are many subtle
issues around inter-version change, and the exact rules are subject to further clarification
based on feedback from implementers.
</p>
[%dragons-end%]

<p>
The following kinds of changes may be made to the specification:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Breaking changes</b> are changes that mean that previously conformant applications are no longer conformant to the updated specification</li>
 <li><b>Substantive changes</b> are changes that introduce new functionality - changes to the specification that create new capabilities - but would not render
  unchanged existing applications non-conformant</li>
 <li><b>Non-substantive changes</b> should not cause changes in any conformant application. For example, section renumbering, correcting broken links, changing styles, fixing typos, and providing clarifications that do not change the meaning of the specification.
    In addition, this covers corrections that are judged not to create any expectation of change to a conformant application</li>
</ul>
<p>
NOTE: The examples provided as part of this specification are never substantive. While every effort is made to ensure that FHIR examples are correct, changes to the examples in the specification are not considered substantive.
</p>
<p>
Content with a status of <i>Draft</i> or <i>Trial Use</i> can change - including Breaking Changes - from
version to version, subject to the rules described by the <a href="#maturity">Maturity Process</a>.  There are no rules for maintaining any sort of compatibility between versions for content with these statuses, though of we will only make breaking changes based on feedback from the community.
</p>
<p>
Once an artifact achieves <i>Normative</i> status, specific rules come into play around inter-version compatibility.  These rules have implication for both forward and backward compatibility and are intended to allow implementations to exercise FHIR interfaces and process the content of FHIR resources safely while exchanging data between systems using different versions of FHIR.
</p>
<p>
<b>Forward compatibility</b> means that content that is conformant in an old release will remain conformant with future versions.  Once normative, FHIR's rules try to enforce forward compatibility.  However, that doesn't guarantee that all old systems will interoperate with future systems.
</p>
<p>
<b>Backward compatibility</b> means that instances created against future versions of the specification will interoperate with older versions of the specification.  This is not guaranteed by FHIR, though there are strategies systems can adhere to that will increase their chances of such interoperability.  Specifically, when dealing with content from a system supporting an unknown normative version and wishing to maximize backwards compatibility, applications SHOULD:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ignore elements that are unexpected (new elements will never be modifier elements)</li>
  <li>Ignore references to resources that are not recognized</li>
  <li>Ignore unrecognized codes in required and extensible bindings unless the element they appear on is a modifier (in which case, treat the element as an unrecognized modifier extension)</li>
  <li>Ignore unrecognized search criteria - see <a href="search.html#errors">Handling Search Errors</a> for further information.</li>
  <li>Respond to HTTP commands on unexpected URLs with an appropriate error code.</li>
</ul>
<p>
However, in a healthcare context, many implementers are unwilling to
consider some of these steps because of concerns about clinical risk or
technical limitations in their software (e.g. schema-based processing).
</p>

<a name="f-compat"></a>
<h4>Forward and backward compatible rules</h4>
The following rules apply once an artifact in the FHIR core specification or in an HL7-international published implementation guide has become normative.
Note that these rules are not, themselves, normative.  They may evolve as HL7 has more experience with changes to normative content.  As well, the FHIR Management Group
has a process allowing violation of these rules in <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FMG/Policy+for+Breaking+Changes">limited and carefully vetted circumstances</a>.

      and meaning of previously existing data elements will not be changed.

      assigned to the repeating items or that there is no preference as to which element is retained.  Systems should

          the reasonable interpretation of data captured using the previous definitions or names.</li>
          <li>Abstract codes may be made concrete.  Concrete codes will not be made abstract.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        For both immutable and non-immutable value sets, additional designations may be declared.
        </p>
        <p>
        Normative CodeSystems whose content is generated from a mix of normative and non-normative contents may
        break these rules.  For example, the code system containing the list of all resources may have codes
        removed or renamed as non-normative resources are removed or renamed.
        </p>
        <p>
        These expectations only apply to Value Sets and Code Systems maintained as part of the FHIR specification.  HL7
        cannot enforce these rules on terminology artifacts maintained by other authorities
        - e.g. UCUM unit codes, ISO language codes, etc.

NOTE: In rare circumstances, HL7 may approve changes that technically break one of the above rules in situations where there is a high level of confidence that the change will not impact existing implementers.  Such deviations from these declared rules will involve broad notification, extensive community consultation and reviews by multiple levels of HL7 governance processes.

<h4>Deprecation / Withdrawal of Normative Content</h4>

<p>
Once content is normative, there is a process for removing it from the standard by marking it as
<code>deprecated</code> or <code>withdrawn</code> (from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/conform.html">HTML 4.0 Standard</a>):
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td><b>Deprecated</b></td><td>Systems should continue to support the artifact/feature/concept, but are discouraged from making use of it</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>Withdrawn</b></td><td>Documented for historical purposes, no longer supported</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The specification will provide guidance with deprecated materials showing how to avoid using them.
<code>Deprecated</code> materials are eligible to be balloted to be <code>withdrawn</code> two years after their <code>deprecated</code> status is published.
</p>
<p>
The computable artifact labels (e.g. codes, element names, urls, etc.) associated with withdrawn materials SHALL not be used in future versions of HL7 specifications.
Materials marked "deprecated" may have that marking removed as part of a subsequent ballot at a later moment, while withdrawn materials SHALL NOT.
</p>
<p>
The following artifacts are deprecated in this version of FHIR:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="operationoutcome-definitions.html#OperationOutcome.issue.location">OperationOutcome.issue.location</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Managing Change during the development process</h3>

<p>
Regardless of the degree of prior implementation, all aspects of the FHIR specification are potentially subject to change while an artifact has a
status of <i>Draft</i> or <i>Trial Use</i>.  These changes may be minor (clarifications of definitions, etc.) or major (refactoring of
resources, changes to serialization rules, eliminating or adding datatypes, etc.)  There is no commitment to backward or forward compatibility
during the trial use process until content is normative.  Changes will not be made without cause, however the interests of long-term
implementability will generally trump the impact on early adopters when determining what changes should be made.  This balance will
shift more towards early adopters as maturity levels increase.  I.e. Impact on existing implementations will be weighted more highly
for an FMM-level 5 artifact than they would for an FMM-level 1 artifact.
</p>
<p>
Implementers who are willing to accept the risk of change (perhaps for the benefit of early implementation experience, first mover advantage and
the ability to leverage FHIR's intrinsic benefits) are encouraged to implement those parts of FHIR that are early in the maturity cycle in
real-world systems.  However, those implementers should be aware that local adaptations may be necessary to meet real-world requirements.
Furthermore, such implementers should architect their solutions to be tolerant of changes to the specification and, where necessary, to
manage interoperability with systems that may be using different versions of the specification or different local adaptations.
</p>
<p>
During the <i>Trial Use</i> period, requests for change may be submitted using the HL7 issue tracker which can be found
<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir-issues">here</a>.  Where possible, updates to the
"development" version of the specification will be made in a timely fashion.  Implementers should be aware that the changes are not
considered "official" until such time as they are balloted and approved as part of a subsequent <i>Trial Use</i> or <i>Normative</i> publication.
Change requests might be fixes to allow implementation, clarifications or enhancements.  In addition, HL7 will be developing and
introducing additional resources and profiles as part of the FHIR specification.
</p>
<p>
SDOs and regulatory bodies that are interested in making use of the FHIR specification should feel free to do so, but should consider and plan for the possibility
that the specification will evolve and change prior to becoming <i>Normative</i>.
</p>
<p>
A key aspect of the FHIR specification development process is gaining feedback from implementers making
use of the specification. As well, the process is conditional on real-world implementation in order to
move through the maturity cycle. For this reason, all FHIR implementers are encouraged to register their
usage <a href="http://fhir.org/implementations/usage">here</a>, which captures contact and other information
that will allow HL7 to perform appropriate monitoring of FHIR usage. Survey information is confidential and reported in aggregate only.
</p>

<a name="extensions"></a>
<h3>Extensions for converting between versions</h3>

<p>
Many implementations need to convert resources from one FHIR version to another. Once resources become
normative (once sufficiently mature and stable), converting resources forwards from past versions is
not needed. Converting back to older versions presents a challenge, however, in that the newer version
may add additional elements that are not present in the older version. In some cases, the elements
are simply irrelevant since the requirements they represent are not in scope for older applications,
but in other cases, it is necessary to represent the data in order to cater for round-tripping.
</p>
<p>
A more complex problem arises with resources that are not yet stable (early in the maturity
process). If applications have implemented less stable resources, not only do they have the
problem of new elements for new requirements, the specification may change in either compatible
or incompatible ways, and it may be necessary to carry data elements from past versions forward
in order to allow seamless round-tripping.
</p>
<p>
In order to help implementers with this problem, any element defined in any version of FHIR
is automatically assigned an extension URL that uniquely identifies the element and can be used
in the relevant FHIR version. The extension URL for an element can automatically be derived:
</p>
<pre>
http://hl7.org/fhir/[version]/StructureDefinition/extension-[Path]
</pre>
<p>
where [version] is taken from this list:
</p>
<p>
This technique can be used with all versions of FHIR, including R2 and R3:
</p>
<table class="grid">
<tr>
<td><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2">FHIR DSTU2</a></td>
<td>1.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3">FHIR R3</a> (STU3, or just R3)</td>
<td>3.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/r4">FHIR R4</a> (mixed STU/Normative)</td>
  <td>4.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/r4b">FHIR R4B</a> (only STU changes)</td>
  <td>4.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/r5">FHIR R5</a> (this version)</td>
  <td>5.0</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that this extension framework only applies back to DSTU2; older versions than that are not supported.
The [Path] is actually the ElementDefinition.id from the relevant
StructureDefinition for the element. This leads to URLs like the
following:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td><code>http://hl7.org/fhir/4.0/StructureDefinition/extension-Bundle.signature</code></td><td><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/4.0/bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.signature">R4 Signature Element on Bundle</a></td></tr>
 <tr><td><code>http://hl7.org/fhir/3.0/StructureDefinition/extension-Patient.animal.species</code></td><td><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/patient-definitions.html#Patient.animal.species">STU3 Species Element on Patient</a></td></tr>
 <tr><td><code>http://hl7.org/fhir/1.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ValueSet.extensible</code></td><td><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/valueset-definitions.html#ValueSet.extensible">DSTU2 ValueSet.extensible</a></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Implementers should be aware of the following issues when using these extensions:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Implementations should always use the correct element for data when one exists. The version <a href="diff.html">differences</a> and <a href="r4maps.html">maps</a> (and their equivalent for other versions) can help</li>
 <li>There is no way to represent the few special elements that have the type "Resource" in extensions, so these are not defined (e.g. <code>Bundle.entry.resource</code>, <code>DomainResource.contained</code>, etc.)</li>
 <li>Where complex datatypes have no equivalent in an earlier version, use a complex extension, 
  where the name of the child properties is the name of the complex extension components, and each of these subextensions
  are extensions that also follow this pattern (see example below).</li>
 <li>This same pattern applies for any new elements not found in datatypes in earlier versions,
  and for additional children where there is a cardinality increase in the referenced (subsequent) version</li>
 <li>If the change between versions is that the subsequent version allows a type that is not allowed in the 
  previous version, then whenever the type is allowed, it should be found in the element, but if it is not,
  then it should be in an extension with the URL of the subsequent version e.g. 
  <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/StructureDefinition/extension-Observation.value</code> for types
  allowed in Observation.value in R5 that were not allowed in an earlier version
 </li>
 <li>It is always an error to use a cross version extension in the same version e.g.
  the extension <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/StructureDefinition/extension-...</code> could
  never appear in an R5 instance.
 </li>
 <li>
  If the data element being referenced has <code>targetProfile</code> elements that refer to resources, 
  only those targetProfile resources that have URLs that exist in the referencing version can exist.  
  If a resource has been renamed, it can't be used in the prior release (note: this is because there's no 
  computable way of determining what names would be allowed); the  <a href="[%extensions-location%]StructureDefinition-alternate-reference.html">alternate-reference</a>
  and <a href="[%extensions-location%]StructureDefinition-alternate-canonical.html">alternate-canonical</a> extensions may be used in this context. E.g. if converting 
  from a version that supports 3 target types when the target version only supports 2 target types, any repetition that referred to 
  the non-supported type would be represented as a reference or canonical instance where the content would just be the alternate extension (and a display, since something must be provided).
 </li>
 <li>
  When converting a data type to a target version where that type does not exist (i.e it's either a simple type that
  will use the mapping table below, or a complex type that will be converted to a set of child extensions), if the 
  converted element is a choice, there will be a <a href="[%extensions-location%]StructureDefinition-datatype.html">child extension _datatype</a>   
  added to the element that will contain the name of the complex type in the source version.
 </li>
 <li>
The extension mechanism carries no information about cardinalities.  If converting from the extension
mechanism to 'core' elements when up-converting or down-converting the resource, the conversion process 
will need to know the max occurs for the element in the target version (e.g. to know whether the element 
should be a JSON array or not).

 </li>
 <li>
  The vocabulary bindings can be to a specific value set version, but the expansions of those value sets 
  will be based on the context of the version of FHIR being used, NOT the version of core the extension 
  definition is taken from
 </li>
 <li>If the referenced type includes target resources that are not supported in the adopting version, those resources will be removed.  If the result is that NO target resources are allowed, then the inter-version extension is not permitted</li>
 <li>Where mapping simple types, the type conversions are shown in the table below. The mapping table SHALL be used</li>
</ul>
<p>
This table shows the mapping between primitive datatypes across versions:

This specification is the result of three years of work by HL7, it's standards, government and implementation partners, 
along with the wider (huge) FHIR implementation community. The FHIR implementation community is now massive, and 
the pace of publication has slowed (as is evident in the <a href="history.html">publication history</a>).

Accordingly, the pace of implementation adoption of new versions is slowing, and it is unclear how 
quickly R5 will be adopted. HL7 will watch the market and survey it's many partners before deciding 
how quickly to pursue the next release, and whether the next release will be a restricted branch 
development from R5 (as R4B was to R4), or whether it will forge ahead with a full new version,
which will be Release 6.
</p>
<p>
Note that for this release, the extensions have been moved out into a separate module and updated
versions will be published regularly. See the 
<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/policy.html">Extension Version Policy</a> for further 
information.
</p>
<p>
Irrespective of the choice around publication speed and whether to publish partial new branch versions,
HL7's general intent for the Release 6 is to move most of the resources in the Foundation, Base and Clinical layers (see the 
'Category' tab in the <a href="resourcelist.html">Resources pages</a>) to full Normative status, along with
a fwe other resources including e.g. Questionnaire. 
</p>
<p>
Whatever HL7 decides to do with regard to the formal status of the resources, the next release will
include additional clarifications, resources, profiles and quality enhancements over the current release based on
implementation experience and ongoing development work. It will also incorporate fixes for issues raised with 
the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir-issues">FHIR issue tracker</a>.  It may be useful for implementers
of this release to review the candidate current release (at <a href="https://build.fhir.org">http://build.fhir.org</a>)
to get a sense of what changes are likely coming and perhaps to find more robust definitions and guidance than are 
available in this release.
</p>
<p>
Some implementers who are dependent on content that exists in a draft release may choose to implement based
on a particular snapshot of the development release, though in doing so, they will limit their potential 
communication partners. In addition, implementers should be aware that most of the implementation tooling 
including those provided by HL7 will not support interim versions other than the latest release.
