		<p>Adverse event tracking in clinical settings and clinical research can differ. In the former case the event is tracked to meet business safety concerns and there is a strong interest in how the event was resolved.

The Vulcan accelerator project suggests two profiles for the use the Adverse Event Resource in Clinical use or Clinical Research use.</p>
