<h3>Version Issues</h3>
<p>
A new code-year of CPT is released by the end of August each year for use the subsequent calendar year. 
CPT versions are identified simply by the year of their release e.g. <code>2020</code>. For example, the CPT 2020 codes are released 
at the end of August 2019 and intended for use during the 2020 calendar year.
</p>
