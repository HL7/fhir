<h3>Version Issues</h3>
<p>
A new code-year of CPT is released by the end of August each year for use the subsequent calendar year. 
CPT versions are identified simply by the year of their release. For example, the CPT 2020 codes are released 
at the end of August 2019 and intended for use during the 2020 calendar year.
</p>
