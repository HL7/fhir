         <h2>Purpose</h2>
         <p>
            The FHIR USLab Order Implementation focuses on identifying the requirements, specifications and
            standards, and on providing the implementation guidance for electronic ordering of laboratory tests in
            the US Realm using <a href="http.html">the FHIR in the RESTful framework</a>. The scope of the Laboratory Orders Interface Use Case includes requirements to enable a
            particular implementation of Electronic Health Record System (EHR-S) to use standardized structured
            data in a defined inter-organizational laboratory transaction. The Use Case requirements are directed at
            laboratory test orders between an Ambulatory Provider's EHR-S and a Laboratory's Laboratory
            Information System (LIS). Future versions of this implementation  may harmonize with existing guides to extend
            interoperability of laboratory results across care settings, e.g., acute care.

         <h2>Audience</h2>
         <p>
            This guide is designed for use by analysts and developers who require guidance on FHIR resources, elements and specific extensions
            relative to the Laboratory Results Interface (LRI) initiative and HL7 Lab Order Conceptual Specification. Users of this guide must be familiar with the details of the FHIR Specification and resource
            processing. This guide is not intended to be a tutorial on that subject.

         <a name="conventions"></a>
         <h2>Conventions</h2>
         <p>
            This guide adheres to the following conventions:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>The guide is constructed assuming the implementer has access to the FHIR Specification. Although some information from the standard is included in this implementation guide, much information from the standard has not been repeated here. </li>
            <li>The guide is constructed assuming the implementer SHALL conform to the <a href="http.html"> FHIR RESTful API</a></li>

            <li>The rules defined in the FHIR Conformance Profile were used to document the use case for, and constraints applied to, the resources described in this guide. </li>
         </ul>
         <!--  EH not needed :  The rules outlined in HL7 2.7.1, Chapter 2B, Section 2B5, Conformance Using Message Profiles,
            were used to document the use case for, and constraints applied to, the messages described in this
            guide. -->
         <!--  EH not needed :  • Data types have been described separately from the fields that use the data types.  -->
         <!--  EH not needed :  •o conformance information is provided for fully optional message elements and segments ("O") or
            unsupported message elements and segments ("X"). This includes cardinality, value sets and
            descriptive information. Implementers who want to use optional message elements should refer to
            the base HL7 V2.5.1 Standard to determine how these optional message elements will be used.
            Conformance information is provided when a conditional predicate resolves to an "R" or "RE" on
            either the "a" or "b" part of the expression, regardless of the opposite value, e.g., C(R/O).
            -->
         <!--  EH not needed : This guide provides conditional predicates for some fields; note that the condition may be dependent
            on data elements that are marked as "O" (optional). In these cases, the interpretation by the reader
            should be "if the optional element is used, then these additional constraints are now required." That
            is, if the optional element is present, then these additional constraints are now active. This guidance
            is included as it is logically true but these conditional elements are not tested. -->
         <!--  EH not needed : This guide uses "X" as a conformance usage indicator very sparingly. Where the underlying standard
            indicates the segments/field/component is present for backwards compatibility ("B") or withdrawn
            ("W") an "X" will be used. A small number of other message elements that are clearly out of scope
            for the use case have been given the "X" usage. All other message elements have either been further
            constrained to R/RE/C(a/b) or have been left as "O" to enable trading partners to explore additional
            capabilities. Note that without a clearly agreed to complementary profile between trading partners,
            an EHR that is compliant with this implementation guide does not have to send any elements marked
            as an "O", nor does a receiver of a lab order that is compliant with this implementation guide have to
            process any elements marked as an "O". Neither trading partner can mandate the other to accept any
            such complementary profiles to enable basic laboratory orders interfacing "out-of-the-box".  -->

            <!--  EH not needed here at least :  Laboratory orders interfaces automate the electronic communication of test order information between

               communication (the message structure, data elements, and vocabularies) of laboratory orders between an
               EHR System and an LIS, based on accepted industry standards, can:

               Improve care delivery and clinical outcomes through the tight coupling of order and result
               messages;
               Reduce implementation efforts and costs;
               Reduce on-going support and maintenance-related activities and costs; and
               Provide an extensible foundation for use in other settings such as acute care and public health.

         <ul>
            <li>Laboratory orders are successfully transmitted electronically from the Provider's (.orderer) EHR System to the Laboratory's LIS. The Receiving Laboratory electronically

            <li>The laboratory processes the laboratory order and associated specimen(s). This step may include
               retrieval and processing of laboratory orders from a queue or list of received orders. Order
               queues may be used in the LIS to hold electronic laboratory orders until associated specimens are
               received and the appropriate patient matching and registration occur (although order queues are
               out of scope for this Use Case). After patient matching and registration, the electronic order may
               be electronically processed in the LIS.
            </li>
            <li>If the laboratory order and specimen(s) are satisfactory for testing the laboratory will perform, or
               attempt to perform, the test(s).
            </li>
            <li>The laboratory test result is obtained, entered/released in the LIS, and sent to the Provider's
               (.orderer) EHR System. This is covered within the Laboratory Results Interface Use
               Case.

         <h4> Scenario 2 - Electronic Ordering Of Add-On Laboratory Test(S)</h4>
         <p>Using an EHR System, a Provider (Order Placer) adds one or more additional tests to a previously
            transmitted test requisition.
            Note that if there is no need to relate the additional order to the specimen associated with a prior order,
            the regular new order must be followed.
            At the time the provider requests an order to be added, this may occur when the specimen is already
            drawn or still needs to be drawn. The provider may not know which situation is in place.
            Therefore, this guide suggests that until there is more clarity on how the provider's ordering system is
            updated with specimen collection information, the provider's add-on order request is communicated as a
            regular order and may use, if known:
         </p>
         <ul>

            placed together and consistent with the original order.
            The third method clearly associates the new order with the same specimen that was already collected for
            a prior order. Note that depending on the state of the order fulfillment, the Laboratory may not be able to
            perform the requested test against the intended specimen as it may be too late for a number of reasons
            (e.g., insufficient specimen, specimen too old).

         <h4> Scenario 3 - Requesting The Cancellation Of A Previously Placed
            Laboratory Order
         </h4>
         <p>The Provider (.orderer) determines that one or more orders from a previously transmitted
            electronic laboratory requisition needs to be cancelled and requests via the EHR that the Laboratory
            cancel the performance of the laboratory order(s).
            Since the Provider does not know how far the Laboratory has progressed with the performance of the
            test, or may not even have received the specimen, the Provider must use the USLabOrder DiagnosticOrder Cancel
            Profile.
            The Laboratory determines whether the test can be cancelled, or whether the order has progressed too
            far to cancel.  Laboratories must use the USLabReport DiagnosticResult Cancel Profile.
            Once the Provider receives any preliminary or final results, the test cannot be cancelled anymore and the
            Provider shall not use the USLabOrder DiagnosticOrder Cancel
            Profile.  anymore.

         <h4>Scenario 4 - Laboratory Cancellation Of A Previously Placed
            Laboratory Order
         </h4>
         <p>
            The Laboratory may cancel laboratory orders and send a cancellation notification
            message to the Provider (Order Placer) because it is unable to perform the laboratory order, independent
            of the Provider requesting cancellation. This applies to an original/initial order or an add-on order.
            Laboratories can cancel a test request received by the LIS (or queue for this purpose) any time before the
            test report (preliminary or final) is transmitted to the provider(s).  Laboratories must use the USLabReport DiagnosticResult Cancel Profile.   See that Implementation Guide for details.  <!-- EH  need to discuss this once wrok out the cancel profile -->

         <h2>Key Technical Decisions</h2>
         <!-- EH not needed : One of the primary features of this implementation guide is its focus on key points of broad
            interoperability. The HL7 implementation guides in Sections 1.2.1
            Relevant Laboratory Implementation Guides and 1.2.2 Requisite Knowledge informed the content of
            this specification as analysis indicated that none of the candidate guides could satisfy the use case
            requirements without some adjustment. This guide is the result of combining the best practices from th
            current body of work while making further adjustment to meet the needs of ambulatory ordering and
            preparing for increased consistency of laboratory orders across care settings. -->
         <a name="profile"></a>
         <h3>Profile And Component Architecture </h3>
         <!-- also in uslaborder.html-->
         <p>This guide uses FHIR profiles on the following resource to define a minimum set of requirements to enable the
            successful exchange of laboratory orders:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>DiagnosticOrder</li>
            <li>DiagnosticReport</li>
            <li>Organization</li>
            <li>Media</li>
            <li>Organization</li>
            <li>Patient</li>
            <li>Practitioner</li>
            <li>Specimen</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
         The main objective is to ensure that EHR systems and
         Laboratory systems can exchange laboratory orders with minimum if any modifications from one
         combination to another combination of software, while maintaining flexibility to enable software
         developers to provide more capabilities using the same core Resource definitions.</p>
         <!--EH not needed: 2.7.2  USE OF ISO OBJECT IDENTIFIER (OID)
            OIDs, or Object Identifiers, provide a strong identifier that uniquely identifies the object in question and
            is global in scope. Examples of information that OIDs can identify are items about patients, orders,
            providers and organizations. This means the identifier includes enough information to remain unique
            when taken out of the context within which the identifier was created. The ISO OID specification
            (ISO/IEC 8824:1990(E)) is the globally accepted technology for this purpose and is recommended as the
            means to satisfy the requirement for a universally unique identifier.
            This guide defines a Globally Unique Component (LOI_GU_Component) (see Section 2.9.1.2) that
            prescribes the use of an ISO Object Identifier (OID) for a specific set of fields.
            The GU/NG profile definition discusses use of OIDs for identifiers' assigning authority only. Other
            identifiers could use OIDs as well for the assigning authority. Note that OIDs are not intended to be used
            to identify a coding system as referenced in CWE-03/CWE-06 and further enumerated in . -->
         <a name="vocabstandards"></a>
         <h3>Use Of Vocabulary Standards</h3>
         <p>This guide calls for specific vocabulary standards for the exchange of laboratory information such as
            LOINC and SNOMED. Standard vocabularies, particularly coded laboratory tests and their results,
            enable automated decision support for patient healthcare, as well as for public health surveillance of
            populations. Value Sets resource are provided as part of this implementation.

            This guide is silent as to the field length definition conventions, lengths, and truncation rules and directs
            the reader to HL7 Version 2.7.1, Chapter 2 Control for informative guidance.  -->
         <a name="implementationscope"></a>
         <h3>Scope Of Implementation</h3>
         <!--EH not needed: The base standard indicates that receiving applications "…shall process (save/print/archive/etc.)…". For
            order-specific segments, e.g., ORC, OBR, SPM, this typically means saving that data. For other
            segments, e.g., MSH, the receiving application may not always have to save the data as the segment is
            focused on ensuring the order-specific data arrives in the appropriate place and therefore may have
            shorter-term value. -->
         <p>Due to receiving system variations and need, this guide does not specifically indicate for each field
            whether to store it or not. This is left to the individual system's scope and purpose.
         </p>
         <a name="aoe"></a>
         <h3>Ask At Order Entry (AOE) Observations </h3>
         <p>Ask at Order Entry (AOE) responses are recorded as observations that provide critical information for
            the calculation or interpretation of some lab results or to satisfy state and federal health agency
            mandated information gathering requirements, e.g., for blood lead testing. Not every order will have the
            need for AOE questions and associated observations. The lab will indicate if and which AOEs to include
            with the order in their test compendium.
            Examples of the type of information gathered from a patient include employment information,
            pregnancy status, the date of the last menstrual period, mother's age, and questions about family and
            personal history. In some cases there may be AOEs that request the outcome of previous results phrased
            as a question, e.g., "Was your previous pap abnormal?"
            AOE responses can take several formats, including but not limited to</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Yes/No (and coded) to answer questions like "Is this your first pregnancy?" </li>
            <li>A code drawn from a value set to provide a coded response to, e.g., "What ethnicity do you
               consider yourself to be?"
            </li>
            <li>A number with units for the mother's age </li>
            <li>A date format for the patient's last menstrual period.</li>
         </ul>
         <p> .supporting information element with type Reference(Observation) must be used in the DiagnosticOrder Resource to convey these Ask at Order Entry questions.</p>
         <p>Although not strictly asked at order entry, other supporting clinical information about the patient
            collected during specimen collection, e.g., fasting status of the patient, are considered AOE observations
            for purposes of this guide and must be communicated using the  .supporting information element with type Reference(Observation) as well.
         </p>
         <p>LOINC shall be used as the standard coding system for AOE questions if an appropriate and valid
            LOINC code exists. The LOINC and local code describing the question will be placed in Observation.name element.  Appropriate and valid status is defined in the LOINC Manual Section 11.2 Classification of LOINC Term Status. If a local coding system is in use, both the LOINC and the local
            code should also be sent to help with identification of coding issues. When no valid LOINC exists, the local code may be the only code sent.

         <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
         <p>
            Note that various Ask at Order Entry questions may appear to have specific elements in FHIR Resources.
            When a clinically relevant value is asked through an Ask at Order Entry question it
            must be conveyed through the OBX segments as described above as these values are used for
            clinical interpretations rather than through a seemingly similar FHIR element.
            The following provide specific examples and guidance whether to use a FHIR element or the supporting information element with type Reference(Observation).
            This is list is not meant to be exhaustive: </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Date of Birth - Always use Patient.birthDate and should never be asked as an AOE as
               there is only one at any point in time.
            </li>
            <li>The extension us-core-race(http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/us-core-race) is provided for demographic (administrative/billing), not clinical use and is bound to define five race categories as  prescribed by federal standards. The
               lab must provide an AOE for those tests where Race drives the interpretation of results. The
               value must be determined by the Ordering Provider and must be sent as the .supporting information element with type Reference(Observation). Note that state and/or national regulations may dictate other behaviors.
            </li>
            <li>The extension us-core-ethnicity(http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/us-core-ethnicity) is provided for demographic (administrative/billing), not clinical use and is bound to specify two ethnicity categories as  prescribed by federal standards. The lab must provide an AOE where Ethnicity drives the interpretation of results. The value must be determined by the Ordering Provider and must be sent as the .supporting information element with type Reference(Observation.  Note that state and/or national regulations may dictate other behaviors. </li>

            <li><b>Laboratory Order:  </b>a DiagnosticOrder Resource item requesting  one or more measurements (Observation Resources). Synonymous with a Requisition when referring to a single DiagnosticOrder Resource item. </li>
            <li><b>Laboratory Order System:  </b>Software, either stand-alone or as part of an EHR system, used by a Provider (Order Placer) to 			manage a  laboratory order, including generating the laboratory requisition and sending it to a laboratory.
               Typically a laboratory order system is an integral part of an order management system that enables users
               to manage orders for many different types of services, procedures, supplies, etc. Since this guide only
               focuses on data exchange relative to laboratory orders it is purposely using a very limited definition.
            </li>
            <li><b>Laboratory Requisition:  </b>A set of information that constitutes an official request for one or more laboratory tests to be performed on
               an individual patient. A laboratory requisition is specified in a clinical setting and communicated to a
               laboratory as a discrete paper or electronic artifact. Laboratory requisitions always include at least one
               test order. In terms of a FHIR order transaction it represents one or more DiagnosticOrders Resource item(s).
            </li>
            <li><b>Newborn:  </b>The precise cutoff when a patient is considered a newborn or an infant is subject to interpretation and this
               guide does not intend to provide a definitive answer to that. For further background the reader is directed
               to the following resources:

             <li><b>Orderable Test:  </b>A request to perform an individual test or panel. It always refers to a single  DiagnosticOrder Resource item. and 		may have one or more associated analytes (bservations).
            </li>
            <li><b>Panel:  </b>While there are differences in the meanings of the terms "panel" among various laboratories, for the
               purposes of this guide, it is defined as a grouping of procedures that measure multiple analytes from a
               single specimen (or multiple specimens in some cases) and can be requested through one laboratory
               order. This is also referred to as a battery. For example, a CBC or a urinalysis may be referred to as a
               panel.
            </li>
            <li><b>Order Set:  </b>A set of laboratory orders that involve multiple tests and panels and that may require multiple specimens,
               but can be requested as a single unit for convenience. For example, a "diabetic order set profile" might
               include a CBC, a glycosylated hemoglobin test, and a urinalysis. The term "panel" is frequently used
               interchangeably with "order set", thus an order set profile that contains a variety of laboratory test orders
               that may be on its own or be combined with other test orders (e.g., radiology image, consult, etc.) can be
               considered an order set. Order sets shall not be communicated to the laboratory.
               Request for Cancellation
               (RFC)
               Request by the Provider (Order Placer) not to perform the order.
            </li>
            <li><b>Test:  </b>A medical procedure or named set of related procedures that involves analyzing one analyte using a
               single sample of blood, urine, or other specimen from a patient for the purpose of diagnosing a disease or
               medical condition, planning or evaluating treatment, or monitoring the course of a disease.
