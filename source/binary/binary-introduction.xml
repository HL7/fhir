<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
There are situations where it is useful or required to handle pure binary content using the same framework as other 
resources. Typically, this is when the binary content is referred to from other FHIR Resources. 
Using the same framework means that the existing servers, security arrangements, code libraries, etc. 
can handle additional related content. Typically, Binary resources are used for handling content such as:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">CDA</a> Documents (i.e. with XDS)</li>
 <li>PDF Documents</li>
 <li>Images</li>
</ul>
<p>
A binary resource can contain any content, whether text, image, pdf, zip archive, etc. These 
resources are served in their native form on the rest interface, but can also be represented in XML, JSON, or other formats, 
such as when including these resources in a Bundle (used when it is convenient to include these in the 
response directly rather than leaving them by reference).

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
When a FHIR server finds it convenient to manage the content within the same overall REST framework 
as the other resources, the Binary resource is generally used as the target in the 
<a href="datatypes.html#Attachment">Attachment</a> data type to reference content via the <code>.url</code> 
element, such as in the DocumentReference resources. Consequently, the Binary resource can 
be a target wherever the Attachment data type is used such as in the DocumentReference resource. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a> resource 
allows conveying binary content (via attachment) or pointing to one (as a <code>Binary</code> or non-FHIR 
URI) along with the metadata around that resource, and as such are searchable.  
Binary resources do not support 'search'.
</p>
<p>
While CDA and PDF documents are conveyed as Binary (because they cannot be expressed natively in FHIR), 
<a href="documents.html">FHIR Documents</a> do not need to be similarly encoded and can be sent natively 
in FHIR using <a href="bundle.html">Bundle</a>.  However, in some situations FHIR Documents may be sent 
as a Binary if there is a need to treat them the same as other types of documents or binary files.
</p>
<p>
The Binary resource does not convey context of the file. If the context (information such as 
author, procedure, technique, etc.) is needed it should be conveyed in a DocumentReference resource.  
The Binary resource may be used to convey actual binary file content conveyed by 
the DocumentReference resource.
