<h3>Serving Binary Resources using the RESTful API</h3>

<p>
Binary resources behave slightly differently to all other resources on the RESTful API.
Specifically, when a read request is made for the binary resource that doesn't explicitly
specify the FHIR content types "application/fhir+xml" or "application/fhir+json", then 
the content should be returned using the content type stated in the resource. 
e.g. if the content type in the resource is "application/pdf", then the content should
be returned as a PDF directly. 
</p>
<p>
Note that due to the way the web infrastructure works, it is not possible to make blanket
rules about the relationship between the "Accept" field in the HTTP request, and the 
return type, which is why there is no hard rule about this. However the intent is that
unless specifically requested, the FHIR XML/JSON representation is not returned. 
</p>
<p>
Note that in the native binary representation, the normal resource <a href="resource.html#meta">metadata</a> 
is not available directly, though some of it is replicated in the HTTP response headers. Specifically, the
following elements of the resource have matching HTTP Headers:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Binary.meta.lastUpdated</b>: <code>Last-Modified</code></li>
 <li><b>Binary.meta.versionId</b>: <code>ETag header</code></li>
 <li><b>Binary.contentType</b>: <code>Content-Type</code></li>
 <li><b>Binary.securityContext</b>: <code>X-Security-Context</code> - this is a FHIR specific extension, primarily intended to allow a the security context for a Binary resource to be specified when it is posted in native form</li>
</ul>
<p>
When a binary is written the server (<a href="http.html#create">create</a>/<a href="http.html#update">update</a> - POST or PUT),
the data is accepted as is and treated as a the binary content of a <code>Binary</code>, including when the content type is "application/fhir+xml" or "application/fhir+json",
except for the special case where the content is actually a <code>Binary</code> resource.
</p>
<p>
Note that when client requests a binary resource using a generic mime type (application/xml, text/xml, or application/json),
the server SHOULD return the content directly if the content-type format matches the 
requested mime type (e.g. if the Accept header is appplication/json, and the <code>contentType</code>
is vnd.xacml+json). However servers may not always be able to interpret mime types correctly,
and clients SHOULD be prepared to receive either format.
</p>
<p>
Note that the _summary parameter does not apply when the mime type is not one of the stanard FHIR content types.
</p>

<h3>Security Considerations</h3>
<p>
Binary resources are not constrained, and therefore can be of any content type and encoding. 
Therefore extra care needs to be taken to validate the content of the Binary resource against 
malicious or malformed content. For more details see <a href="security.html#narrative">Security of Narrative</a>.
</p>
<p>
Very often, the content of a binary resource is sensitive, and the server should apply 
appropriate access control to the content. When the server itself generates the content, 
it implicitly knows what access control to apply. When the client provides the binary to 
the server itself, it uses the <code>securityContext</code> element (or the matching 
<code>X-Security-Context</code> HTTP header) to inform the server that the Binary resource 
should be treated as if it was the other resource. Typically, the other resource is a 
DocumentReference or similar resource that refers directly to the Binary resource, but 
that is not mandatory.
