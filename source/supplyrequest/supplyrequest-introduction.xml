<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The scope of the SupplyRequest resource is for recording the request of supplies used in the healthcare process.  This includes supplies specifically
used in the treatment of patients as well as supply movement within an institution (transport a set of supplies from 
materials management to a service unit (nurse station).  This resource does not include the provisioning of transportation
services.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
Note that the SupplyRequest a record of the fact that a request was made. To actually request that a a supply be ordered, additional workflow beyond simply the existence of a SupplyRequest is required. This can be achieved by using an <a href="order.html">Order</a> resource, with the SupplyRequest referenced from the <i>Order.details</i>, or by using the SupplyRequest resource in the context of an messaging or service workflow where the request is explicit or implicit.
</p>
<p>
This resource overlaps with <a href="deviceuserequest.html">DeviceUseRequest</a> and <a href="medicationprescription.html">MedicationPrescription</a>. The <b>SupplyRequest</b> resource may be used to request medication, substances and devices when handling them generically (as any other supply).  For example, when processing bulk orders, etc.  TODO - finish defining boundaries.
