		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>This resource is a <em>request</em> resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a>.  It is the intent of the Orders and Observation Workgroup to align this resource with  the workflow  pattern for <a href="workflow.html">
					<em>request</em> resources</a>.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
The scope of the SupplyRequest resource is for recording the request of supplies used in the healthcare process.  This includes supplies specifically
used in the treatment of patients as well as supply movement within an institution (transport a set of supplies from 
materials management to a service unit (nurse station).  This resource does not include the provisioning of transportation
services.

		<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
		<p>Note that the SupplyRequest records the fact that a request was made. To actually act on that request, additional workflow beyond simply the existence of a SupplyRequest is required. This can be achieved by using an <a href="task.html">Task</a> resource, with the SupplyRequest referenced from the Task.focus, or by using the SupplyRequest resource in the context of an messaging or service workflow where the request is explicit or implicit.  The <a href="supplydelivery.html">SupplyDelivery</a> resource represents the fulfillment as a result of SupplyRequest being acted upon.
		</p>
		<p>The SupplyRequest resource is used for <em>inventory management</em>.       When requesting medication, substances and devices when there is a patient focus or instructions regarding their use, <a href="deviceuserequest.html">DeviceUseRequest</a> or <a href="medicationrequest.html">MedicationRequest</a> should be used instead
