FHIR Validation tool

The FHIR validation tool validates a FHIR resource or bundle.
Schema and schematron checking is performed, then some additional checks are performed

JSON is not supported at this time

Usage: FHIRValidator.jar [source] (-defn [definitions]) (-output [output]) where: 
* [source] is a file name or url of the resource or bundle feed to validate
* [definitions] is the file name or url of the validation pack (validation.zip). Default: get it from hl7.org
* [output] is a filename for the results (OperationOutcome). Default: results are sent to the std out.

Or, you can use the java class directly in the jar. Quick Doco:

Class org.hl7.fhir.tools.validator.Validator
methods:
  void setSource(string) - see above
  void setDefinitions(string) - see above
  void process(); - actually perform the validation (may throw Exception)
  String getOutcome(); - the outcome as an OperationOutcome resource represented as a string
  
  
License:
The validator itself is covered the license below. The java includes files with many other 
open source licenses. TODO: chase them down and put them in here....
