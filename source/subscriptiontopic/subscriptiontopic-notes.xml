	<h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
	<p>
		Each server is responsible for accurately implementing each SubscriptionTopic it advertises support for.  Due to the breadth of possible topics, detailed implementation guidance cannot be provided here.  Following are a few points to consider when implementing a Subscription Topic within a server:
	</p>

  <a name="defining" />
  <h2>Defining Subscription Topics</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> resource is designed to define what is possible for a subscription - what causes a server to generate notifications, what related information notifications contain, and what a client can use to filter a class of possible subscriptions down to what that particular client is interested in.  Implementers and users SHOULD be able to use a subscription topic to arrive at the same expectations.
  </p>
	<p>
		Defining a new <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> requires clear communication around requirements and expectations.  Anyone defining a <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> is encouraged to publish their definition at <a href="https://registry.fhir.org/">registry.fhir.org</a>.  Similarly, before defining a new <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> implementers are encouraged to check the registry to see if an existing definition can be reused (either directly or as a base for derivation).
	</p>
  <p>
    Note that <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> is a <a href="canonicalresource.html">Canonical Resource</a> and inherits many elements related to authoring and publication.  Authors SHOULD review inherited elements and populate them accordingly.
  </p>
	
	<a name="concept-definition" />
	<h3>Conceptual Definition</h3>
	<p>
		Subscription Topics MUST always document the concept it represents.  While a short definition is included in the <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> itself, this documentation will typically not be sufficient for implementers.  Definitions must be clear and specific.  For example, if the goal is to define an 'admission' topic, the single word is common enough to feel sufficient - implementers generally know what an 'admission' is and could implement something that would qualify.  However, is the intention to represent a patient being physically admitted to a care facility, or the start of a clinical encounter?  Either definition is common, and without more information implementations will not be consistent.  Without complete and specific definitions, server implementations will vary and clients will have unexpected behavior.
	</p>

  <a name="resource-scope" />
  <h3>Resource Scope</h3>
  <p>
    Note that Subscription Topics are not limited to a single 'base' resource. As described on the <a href="subscriptions.html#multi-resource-topics">Subscriptions Framework</a> page, there are scenarios where multiple resources are in context for a single topic. When multiple resources are in scope, they may appear in:
    <ul>
      <li>a single <code>resourceTrigger.resource</code>, via a lower-level grouping (e.g., <code>Resource</code>),</li>
      <li>multiple <code>resourceTrigger</code> repetitions, each with a different <code>resource</code> value,</li>
      <li>a single <code>eventTrigger.resource</code>, via a lower-level grouping (e.g., <code>Resource</code>), or</li>
      <li>multiple <code>eventTrigger</code> repetitions, each with a different <code>resource</code> value.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    When multiple resources are in scope, topic authors are responsible for ensuring that available filtering parameters are clear in their scope.  For example, if a topic is scoped to <code>Resource</code>, an allowed filter based on <code>_language</code> is clear and applicable to any possible resource.  However, a search parameter of <code>patient</code> does not make sense in the context of all resources, since many resources do not include that search parameter.  Note that the resource specified in <code>canFilterBy.resource</code> does not need to match the literals specified by triggers.  For example, an event that triggers on all resource can specify different filters for each resource type.
  </p>

  <a name="triggers-vs-filters" />
  <h3>Triggers vs. Filters</h3>
  <p>
    Subscription Topics contain two sets of evaluation criteria - one set as part of triggers (i.e., <code>resourceTrigger</code>, <code>eventTrigger</code>) and the other as part of filters (i.e., <code>canFilterBy</code>).  Triggers are the tests used to generate any notification by any subscription linked to a topic, while filters are the tests used by each subscription to differentiate the notifications they are interested in.  For example, a topic could be defined to trigger for any new <a href="medicationrequest.html">MedicationRequest</a> - this allows server implementers to optimize tests at a single point.  However, a patient is only interested in medication requests for <i>them</i>, which would be represented by a filter (e.g., on <code>MedicationRequest.patient</code>).  The set of allowed filters are defined by the subscription topic, but actual values for filtering are listed in the <a href="subscription.html">Subscription</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This logical separation of triggers and filters exists to limit the complexity of topics. However, this specification does not place any architectural requirements on severs regarding the separation of triggers and filters.  An implementation is free to separate the two portions or combine the tests as desired.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that triggers can be defined in three ways: as part of the conceptual definition, a computable <code>resourceTrigger</code>, and/or a possibly-computable <code>eventTrigger</code>.  Topics without computable definitions are not expected to trigger unless a server has explicitly added support for them.  For example, a trigger could be based on a complex set of criteria that is difficult to express or depend on information not available in a FHIR context (e.g., user information).  Servers can implement these topics, but they require software changes and cannot be expected to trigger notifications generally.  Servers MAY reject <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> resources that do not include computable definitions or depend on mechanisms the implementation does not support.
  </p>

	<a name="resource-operation-pairs" />
	<h3>Triggers and Resource Interactions</h3>
	<p>
		Subscription Topics based on Resource Interactions are simple to describe - definitions include the resource type (e.g., <code>Patient</code>, <code>Encounter</code>) and the interaction of interest (e.g., <code>create</code>, <code>delete</code>).
	</p>
	<p>
		Subscription Topics for resource interactions are defined using the <code>SubscriptionTopic.resourceTrigger.resource</code> and <code>SubscriptionTopic.resourceTrigger.supportedInteraction</code> elements.
	</p>
  <p>
    If a topic is designed to cover multiple resources, it can contain multiple <code>resourceTrigger</code> elements with each resource.  If a topic is generic to all resources, the <code>Resource</code> is available within the <a href="valueset-fhir-types.html">FHIR Type</a> value set.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that <code>supportedInteraction</code> filters can be used either alone, resulting in notifications for every time a resource has the interaction (e.g., every <code>create</code>), or with either <code>queryCriteria</code> or <code>fhirPathCriteria</code>.  When one or more supported interactions are defined, criteria SHOULD only be evaluated for interactions that are included.  For example, a FHIRPath expression designed for resource updates might not test for the previous state correctly during create processing.
  </p>
	
		<a name="resource-trigger-create" />
		<h4>Trigger Interaction: Create</h4>
		<p>
			Subscription Topics that include <code>create</code> interactions are tested each time a resource of the specified type is created.  If a topic contains no trigger criteria (either query-based or FHIRPath), a notification will be generated for every instance created.  If criteria are specified, the criteria SHOULD only be evaluated after the interaction is confirmed to apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using <code>queryCriteria</code> during a create, the <code>previous</code> test does not have a defined behavior - there is no resource available to test against.  In order to filter correctly, a combination of <code>resultForCreate</code> and <code>requireBoth</code> must be specified.  For example, setting both <code>resultForCreate</code> and <code>requireBoth</code> to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> will result in criteria that can be tested against all interactions with expected behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using <code>fhirPathCriteria</code> during a create, the <code>%previous</code> variable will be set to empty (<code>{}</code>). Authors should ensure that expressions can be evaluated without errors in all applicable situations.
    </p>
		
		<a name="resource-trigger-delete" />
		<h4>Trigger Interaction: Delete</h4>
		<p>
			Subscription Topics that include <code>delete</code> interactions are triggered each time a resource of the specified type is deleted.  If a topic contains no trigger criteria (either query-based or FHIRPath), a notification will be generated for every instance deleted.  If criteria are specified, the criteria SHOULD only be evaluated after the interaction is confirmed to apply.
		</p>
    <p>
      When using <code>queryCriteria</code> during a delete, the <code>current</code> test does not have a defined behavior - there is no resource available to test against.  In order to filter correctly, a combination of <code>resultForDelete</code> and <code>requireBoth</code> must be specified.  For example, setting both <code>resultForDelete</code> and <code>requireBoth</code> to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> will result in criteria that can be tested against all interactions with expected behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using <code>fhirPathCriteria</code> during a delete, the <code>%current</code> variable will be set to empty (<code>{}</code>). Authors should ensure that expressions can be evaluated without errors in all applicable situations.
    </p>
		
		<a name="resource-trigger-update" />
		<h4>Trigger Interaction: Update</h4>
		<p>
			Subscription Topics that include <code>update</code> interactions are triggered each time the server updates a resource of the specified type.  Triggering an <code>update</code> operation does not imply that the resource has changes visible to the subscriber, nor does it require servers to monitor resources for actual changes.  Servers MAY generate notifications on their internal triggers, regardless of actual changes (e.g., a client issuing an HTTP PUT with an identical resource).
		</p>
    <p>
      When using <code>queryCriteria</code> during an update, both the <code>previous</code> and <code>current</code> tests can apply.  In most cases, an update should set <code>requireBoth</code> and ensure that the elements of interest are the ones changed to avoid generating notifications on unrelated updates.  For example, if a topic is looking for changes to <code>Encounter.status</code>, only checking that the <code>current</code> status is <code>in-progress</code> would trigger notifications on changes to the <code>Encounter.diagnosis</code> for an in-progress encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using <code>fhirPathCriteria</code> during an update, it is recommended to test both the <code>%previous</code> and <code>%current</code> contents to ensure that only desired changes are captured.  For example, if a topic is looking for changes to <code>Encounter.status</code>, only checking that the <code>%current</code> status is <code>in-progress</code> would trigger notifications on changes to the <code>Encounter.diagnosis</code> for an in-progress encounter.
    </p>
	
	<a name="resource-value-tests" />
	<h3>Resource Value Tests</h3>
	<p>
		If a topic requires more granularity than interactions provide, a topic can provide state-change tests using either <a href="fhirpath.html">FHIRPath</a> or query (<a href="search.html">Search</a>) definitions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Computable Definitions serve two purposes when defining topics. First, some server implementers may be able to use computable definitions directly or with minimal changes. In this scenario, the benefit of a computable definition is quite large (e.g., user-defined Subscription Topics, high portability, etc.). Second, implementers that do not use computable definitions directly will be able to read definitions during their implementation in order to precisely understand what is being defined.
	</p>

		<a name="query-criteria" />
		<h4>Query (Search) Trigger Definitions</h4>
		<p>
			Query definitions are based on Search evaluations performed before and/or after a state change in the server.  Allowed query parameters are based on the <code>resourceTrigger.resource</code> (e.g., if the resource is an <a href="encounter.html">Encounter</a>, the list of available search parameters can be found <a href="encounter.html#search">here</a>).
		</p>
    <p>
      Because FHIR search expressions are evaluated against a single resource, <code>queryCriteria</code> provides two elements for including criteria - <code>previous</code> for an expression tested against the resource as it existed before the current interaction and <code>current</code> for an expression tested against the resource as it exists after the current interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using query criteria, it is important to note the interaction between the <code>supportedInteraction</code> element, the <code>previous</code> and <code>resultForCreate</code> elements, the <code>current</code> and <code>resultForDelete</code> elements, and the <code>requireBoth</code> element.  More information can be found in the <a href="#resource-operation-pairs">Triggers and Resource Interactions</a> section of this page.
    </p>

		<a name="fhirpath-criteria" />
		<h4>FHIRPath Trigger Definitions</h4>
		<p>
			FHIRPath expressions can be used to define topical state changes in a server.  The FHIRPath expression is assumed to be provided the inputs listed below.
		</p>
		<p>
			FHIRPath expression input variables:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Variable <code>%previous</code> - resource instance prior to state change being applied
        </li>
        <li>
          Variable <code>%current</code> - resource instance post state change being applied
        </li>
      </ul>
		</p>
    <p>
      For example, the expression: <code>%previous.status!='in-progress' and %current.status='in-progress'</code> indicates that the resource has an element, <code>status</code>, and that notifications are generated if the pre-update version status is not 'in-progress' and the post-update version is 'in-progress'.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the resource trigger includes a <code>supportedInteraction</code> filter, the FHIRPath expression SHALL only be tested for the listed interactions.  Note that empty-checking must be included in a FHIRPath test if the test includes properties that do not exist for interactions included in the trigger.  To continue with the above example, if the test should be applied to <code>create</code> interactions in addition to <code>update</code> ones, a more complete expression would be: <code>(%previous.empty() | (%previous.status != 'in-progress')) and (%current.status = 'in-progress')</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using FHIRPath criteria, it is important to note the interaction between the <code>supportedInteraction</code> element and the <code>%previous</code> and <code>%current</code> variables.  More information can be found in the <a href="#resource-operation-pairs">Triggers and Resource Interactions</a> section of this page.
    </p>

	<a name="definition-event" />
	<h3>Event Trigger Definitions</h3>
  <p>
    There are use-cases when a triggering event is not easily described in terms of FHIR resources (e.g., shift change at a facility) or that an existing workflow is already defined on an event-based system (e.g., patient admission in HL7v2).  To support these scenarios Subscription Topics MAY include an event trigger, either instead of or in addition to resource triggers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Event triggers are straightforward to define, since most of the definition exists in the event.  The <a href="subscriptiontopic-definitions.html#SubscriptionTopic.eventTrigger.event">event</a> element references the event which causes a Subscription to trigger.  For example, using the event <code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0003#A01</code> indicates that a Subscription activates under the same conditions that a HL7v2 system would send an <code>ADT^A01</code> message.  Similarly, an event trigger using <code>http://fhircast.org/events/patient-open</code> indicates that a Subscription activates under the same conditions that a FHIRcast Hub generates a <code>patient-open</code> message.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to allow Subscriptions to filter event-based topic definitions, event definitions require a "root" FHIR resource that can be referenced.  This is defined in the <a href="subscriptiontopic-definitions.html#SubscriptionTopic.eventTrigger.resource">eventTrigger.resource</a> element.  For example, a HL7v2 patient admission event (<code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0003#A01</code>) would likely be rooted in an Encounter resource, while a FHIRcast patient open event (<code>http://fhircast.org/events/patient-open</code>) would likely be rooted in a Patient resource.  By establishing the appropriate root resource for an event, topics can expose filters that are appropriate for notifications.  If there is no logical resource available (e.g., events referencing non-FHIR events), resources such as <a href="parameters.html">Parameters</a> or <a href="basic.html">Basic</a> may be used.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that while having a conceptual description and linking to an event is sufficient for a definition, authors are encouraged to include resource triggers if possible.
  </p>

	<a name="filters"/>
	<h3>Defining Allowed Filters</h3>
	<p>
    To help servers filter a large set of topic notifications into a smaller set of events that a particular client is interested in, each <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> defines a set of filters that clients are allowed to request. For example, filters can be used to allow a <code>Subscription</code> to narrow down notifications from a topic defining all patient admissions to a just admissions for patients for a specific care team.
	</p>
  <p>
    Note that filters can be defined either to a single resource type (e.g., <code>Patient</code>) or to the 'lower-level' resource types (e.g., <code>Resource</code>). When defining allowed filters across resources, care should be taken to ensure that the parameters correctly apply to all resources included in scope. For example, a filter defined for <code>Resource</code> has well-defined behavior for search parameters like <a href="search.html#_language">_language</a>, <a href="search.html#_source">_source</a>, and <a href="search.html#_tag">_tag</a>, but there is not a well-defined behavior for a parameter like <a href="searchparameter-registry.html#clinical-patient">patient</a> across resources that are not in the patient compartment.  Servers MAY reject subscriptions requests that are include too broad filters, determine at the time of creation which resources the parameter is applied to, or test each resource at runtime.  More information is available on the <a href="subscriptions.html#resource-filters">Subscriptions Framework</a> page.
  </p>

		<a name="filters-param-name"/>
		<h4>Filter Parameter</h4>
		<p>
			The element <code>canFilterBy.filterParameter</code> contains the name of a parameter used to filter events for the focus resource, as defined by <code>resourceTrigger.resource</code> or <code>eventTrigger.resource</code>.  The name used in this element is only valid in the context of the Subscription Topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The filter parameter MAY be a Search Parameter, either from the list of <a href="search.html#Summary">Parameters for all resources</a> (e.g., <code>_id</code>, <code>_tag</code>) or Search Parameter defined for a specific resource (e.g., <a href="encounter.html#search">Encounter Search Parameters</a>, <a href="patient.html#search">Patient search parameters</a>, etc.).  When a Search Parameter is used, the topic SHALL contain a reference to a valid canonical definition in the <code>canFilterBy.filterDefinition</code> element.
		</p>
    <p>
      The filter parameter MAY be a filter defined in the context of a topic.  When a parameter is defined by a topic, the <code>canFilterBy.filterDefinition</code> SHOULD point to a URL containing detailed information about the parameter - e.g., datatype of the parameter.
    </p>

    <a name="filter-param-definition"/>
    <h4>Filter Definition</h4>
    <p>
      Filters MAY have external definitions.  For example, Search Parameters defined in the FHIR Specifications have canonical URLs in the format of <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/[id]</code> (see <a href="searchparameter-registry.html">Search Parameter Registry</a>). with Search Parameters, it is possible that two externally-defined filters share the same "short" name.  In these cases, the URI contained in the <code>filterDefinition</code> element is used to link a context-local name for the parameter (<code>filterParameter</code>) to the complete definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      As described in <a href="#filters-param-name">Filter Parameter</a>, parameters backed by full Search Parameter definitions SHALL contain a link to the canonical URL in this element and other parameters SHOULD contain a useful URI in this element.
    </p>

		<a name="filters-comparator"/>
		<a name="filters-modifier"/>
		<h4>Comparators and Modifiers</h4>
    <p>
      In addition to the element or elements for a filter, sometimes it is necessary to describe additional behavior used in the filtering tests (e.g., asking for values in a range). To specify this, filters can specify <code>comparator</code> and <code>modifier</code> values, matching the behaviors defined by <a href="searchparameter.html">SearchParameters</a>.  Details about interactions with element types can be found on the search page, in the <a href="search.html#modifiers">Modifiers</a> and <a href="search.html#prefix">Prefixes</a> sections. 
    </p>
		<p>
      Note:
      <ul>
        <li>If no <code>comparator</code> or <code>modifier</code> is provided, the comparison is the default <code>=</code> match.</li>
        <li>If a filter parameter is a defined Search Parameter, the list of allowed modifiers SHALL be a strict subset of the modifiers defined on the Search Parameter.</li>
        <li>While filters may allow both, no single filter value allowed to have both a <code>comparator</code> and a <code>modifier</code>.</li>
      </ul>
		</p>

		<a name="filters-timing"/>
		<h4>Filter Timing and Interactions</h4>
		<p>
			When a server evaluates filters depends on the type of change covered by the topic.  Guidance is provided based on implementation feedback, but note that all filters are defined to explicitly describe the state before and after the interaction occurs.
		</p>
    <p>
      Note that while the <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> resource defines filters that can be exposed to clients, actual filters and their values are specified by the <a href="subscription.html">Subscription</a> resource.
    </p>

			<a name="filters-timing-create"/>
			<h5>Filters on Create Interactions</h5>
			<p>
				Logically, subscription filters evaluated against <code>create</code> interactions must be performed after the resource has been created. For example, a topic interested in new patients may allow filters on elements within the patient resource (e.g., new patients in a specified age range).
			</p>

			<a name="filters-timing-delete"/>
			<h5>Filters on Delete Interactions</h5>
			<p>
				Logically, query filters evaluated against <code>delete</code> interactions must be performed before the resource has been deleted. For example, a topic interested in practitioners being removed may allow filters on the practitioner resource (e.g., removed practitioners with a specific qualification).
			</p>

			<a name="filters-timing-update"/>
			<h5>Filters on Update Interactions</h5>
			<p>
				Logically, query filters evaluated against <code>update</code> interactions MAY be performed either before or after the update occurs.  For clarity, it is recommended that a topic does not define filters for the same resource elements being test for the notification triggers.  For example, if a topic is looking for changes on the <code>Encounter.status</code> element, a filter for that element would always have different values in the two states.  If a topic requires a filter on one of the elements present in the triggers, the author SHOULD explain in the topic definition when filters should be applied.
			</p>

  <a name="notification-shape"/>
  <h3>Notification Shape</h3>
  <p>
    In addition to the triggering information for a topic, this resource also defines the expected 'shape' of notifications via <code>notificationShape</code>.  Each shape is defined according to a resource via the <code>notificationShape.resource</code> element. This is the 'focus' resource of the topic, or one of them if there are more than one, and the root resource for that shape definition.  It will be the same, a generality, or a specificity of <code>resourceTrigger.resource</code> or <code>eventTrigger.resource</code> when they are present.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that multiple <code>notificationShape</code> elements can exist for the same resource, so that a server can indicate that there are multiple groupings of resources that may be sent. For example, a business-to-business (B2B) topic may include notifications on all changes to Patient resources, but may want to define that sometimes a Patient will include Encounters and other times Conditions.
  </p>

  <a name="shape-root-resource"/>
  <h4>Root Resource</h4>
  <p>
    The element <code>notificationShape.resource</code> defines a 'root' resource for notifications.  Typically, this resource will be the same as the triggering resource (e.g., <code>resourceTrigger.resource</code> or <code>eventTrigger.resource</code>), however there may be situations where this is not the case.  For example, a topic may be defined across all resources (e.g., every time a resource is deleted), but the author may want additional information depending on which resource is involved.  In that scenario, the <code>resourceTrigger.resource</code> could be set to <code>Resource</code> to trigger on all resources.  However, shapes could be defined for each resource in the patient compartment to include patient information with those notifications (e.g., if an <code>Encounter</code> is deleted, include the <code>Patient</code> record as well).  Note that the opposite scenario is also supported - an author may define multiple triggers on different types of events and simply define a shape that is valid for all of those resources.
  </p>
 
  <a name="shape-additional-resources"/>
  <h4>Including Additional Resources</h4>
  <p>
    Sometimes it is beneficial to include additional resources with a subscription notification.  For example, queries for additional resources may be complex in the future, but simple at the time of notification due to context in the event.  Alternatively, the subscriber may have limited ability to request additional resource (e.g., a client that is generally offline).
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to facilitate these workflows, a Subscription can define additional resources that MAY be included when a notification is sent.  These additions are based off of the focus resource of the notification, and are described as a list of <a href="search.html#include">_include and _revinclude</a> directives.  When notifications are generated, a server SHOULD check the appropriate <code>notificationShape.resource</code> for a matching resource and SHOULD include any additional resources listed via <code>notificationShape.include</code> and <code>notificationShape.revInclude</code>, if they exist and the user context for the subscription is authorized to access them.  Clients SHOULD be prepared to receive these additional resources, but SHALL function properly without them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Included resources SHOULD be added in the same style as the focus resource - e.g., if notifications are <code>id-only</code>, then included resources should only include their ids as well.
  </p>

	<a name="deriving" />
	<h2>Deriving from existing Subscription Topics</h2>
  <p>
    By populating the <a href="subscriptiontopic-definitions.html#SubscriptionTopic.derivedFrom">derivedFrom</a> element, implementers can advertise that a new topic is compatible with, and offers additional features on top of, another Subscription Topic. A derived topic can add additional filters, but cannot remove existing ones nor change the 'concept' of a topic during derivation.  For example:
  </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Deriving a new SubscriptionTopic with the same concept but a different computable definition is OK.</li>
		<li>Deriving a new SubscriptionTopic to expose additional canFilterBy parameters is OK.</li>
		<li>Deriving a new SubscriptionTopic to remove an existing canFilterBy parameter is NOT ok.</li>
		<li>Deriving a new SubscriptionTopic based on a different resource than its parent is NOT ok (e.g., start/end of medication derived from encounter).</li>
	</ul>
