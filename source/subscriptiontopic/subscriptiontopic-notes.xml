  <h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
  <p>
    Each server is responsible for accurately implementing each SubscriptionTopic it advertises support for. Due to the
    breadth of possible topics, detailed implementation guidance cannot be provided here. Following are a few points to
    consider when implementing a Subscription Topic within a server:
  </p>

  <a name="defining" />
  <h2>Defining Subscription Topics</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> resource is designed to define what is possible for a subscription - what causes
    a server to generate notifications, what related information notifications contain, and what a client can use to
    filter a class of possible subscriptions down to what that particular client is interested in. Implementers and
    users SHOULD be able to use a subscription topic to arrive at the same expectations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Defining a new <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> requires clear communication around requirements and expectations.
    Anyone defining a <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> is encouraged to publish their definition at <a
      href="https://registry.fhir.org/">registry.fhir.org</a>. Similarly, before defining a new
    <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> implementers are encouraged to check the registry to see if an existing definition
    can be reused (either directly or as a base for derivation).
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> is a <a href="canonicalresource.html">Canonical Resource</a> and inherits
    many elements related to authoring and publication. Authors SHOULD review inherited elements and populate them
    accordingly.
  </p>

  <a name="concept-definition" />
  <h3>Conceptual Definition</h3>
  <p>
    Subscription Topics MUST always document the concept it represents. While a short definition is included in the
    <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> itself, this documentation will typically not be sufficient for implementers.
    Definitions must be clear and specific. For example, if the goal is to define an 'admission' topic, the single word
    is common enough to feel sufficient - implementers generally know what an 'admission' is and could implement
    something that would qualify. However, is the intention to represent a patient being physically admitted to a care
    facility, or the start of a clinical encounter? Either definition is common, and without more information
    implementations will not be consistent. Without complete and specific definitions, server implementations will vary
    and clients will have unexpected behavior.
  </p>

  <a name="resource-scope" />
  <h3>Resource Scope</h3>
  <p>
    Note that Subscription Topics are not limited to a single 'base' resource. As described on the <a
      href="subscriptions.html#multi-resource-topics">Subscriptions Framework</a> page, there are scenarios where
    multiple resources are in context for a single topic. When multiple resources are in scope, they may appear in:
  <ul>
    <li>a single <code>trigger.resource</code>, via a lower-level grouping (e.g., <code>Resource</code>),</li>
    <li>multiple <code>trigger</code> repetitions, each with a different <code>resource</code> value,</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    When multiple resources are in scope, topic authors are responsible for ensuring that available filtering parameters
    are clear in their scope. For example, if a trigger is scoped to <code>Resource</code>, an allowed filter based on
    <code>_language</code> is clear and applicable to any possible resource. However, a search parameter of
    <code>patient</code> does not make sense in the context of all resources, since many resources do not include that
    search parameter. Note that the resource specified in <code>canFilterBy.resource</code> does not need to match the
    literals specified by triggers. For example, an event that triggers on all resource can specify different filters
    for each resource type.
  </p>

  <a name="non-fhir-data"></a>
  <h3>Non-FHIR Data</h4>
  <p>
    A Subscription Topic can be intended for use with a non-FHIR focus. There are several approaches for including and 
    describing non-FHIR data in relation to subscriptions. Each approach has different trade-offs in terms of complexity, type
    safety, and ease of implementation. Below are some common approaches and considerations regarding triggering,
    filtering, and notifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the examples for this section are based on a Patient Admission, which <em>does</em> have relevant FHIR
    resources and those representations would be used in any real implementation. The examples are purely illustrative of
    how non-FHIR data could be represented in a Subscription Topic context, and using a familiar use-case makes the 
    examples easier to understand.
  </p>

  <a name="non-fhir-lm"></a>
  <h4>Logical Models</h4>
  <p>
    If the non-FHIR data can be represented as a FHIR Logical Model, it can be a good option for triggering and filtering.
    If the serialization of the model is stable in the implementation context, Logical Models can be used as the notification 
    resource as well (e.g., using a JSON notification format and including a CDS Hooks model).
  </p>
  <p>
    Authors are encouraged to keep in mind that non-FHIR content is not expected to be accessible via the FHIR-based Logical 
    Model directly during processing. Implementers are likely to map any filtering and triggering logic to the native format 
    of the non-FHIR data instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note additionally that Search Parameter definitions cannot directly target Logical Models. Search Parameter resources 
    can still be defined to establish types and show the relative path.
  </p>
  <p>
    Related examples:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="subscriptiontopic-example-admission-lm.html">SubscriptionTopic for Admission using a Logical Model</a></li>
      <li><a href="notification-id-only-lm.html">Notification Bundle for a Logical Model</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <a name="non-fhir-basic"></a>
  <h4>Basic Representation</h4>
  <p>
    If non-FHIR data is expected to be persisted and referenced like other FHIR resources, the <a href="basic.html">Basic</a>
    resource can be used. However, implementers must be aware that Basic requires mandatory
    fields (code, subject) that may not be meaningful for all non-FHIR events, and the non-FHIR data must be encoded
    using extensions or contained resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    When using Basic to represent non-FHIR data, care should be taken to ensure that the structure is well-defined
    and consistent across notifications. Clear documentation of the expected extension names and data types is essential
    for implementers to correctly interpret the non-FHIR content. It is recommended to create a Profile based on the Basic
    resource to formalize the structure and constraints of the non-FHIR data representation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that there are some challenges regarding filtering when using Basic as the root resource. Custom Search 
    Parameters can be defined using FHIRPath expressions to traverse Extensions using navigational functions such as 
    <code>children()</code> and <code>descendants()</code>, but care must be taken in the structure to make extraction feasible. 
    When defining complex extensions, it is recommended to use <code>extension.url</code> values in sub-extensions that are
    compatible with FHIR search parameter naming conventions to ease mapping between filters and instance content (e.g., no 
    spaces or special characters that require URL encoding).
  </p>
  <p>
    Authors are encouraged to keep in mind that non-FHIR content is not typically in a Basic format during processing.
    Implementers are likely to map any filtering and triggering logic to the native format of the non-FHIR data instead.
  </p>

    </ul>
  </p>

  <a name="non-fhir-parameters"></a>
  <h4>Parameters Representation</h4>
  <p>
    A <a href="parameters.html">Parameters</a> resource can be used as the root resource, with parameter parts containing 
    <code>Attachment</code>, <code>uri</code>, <code>url</code>, or <code>base64Binary</code> valued elements to reference
    external data. This approach allows the structure of the Parameters resource to describe the organization of the 
    non-FHIR data while maintaining type safety through FHIR data types.
  </p>
  <p>
    For non-FHIR data with complex structure, Parameters can use nested
    parameter parts to represent hierarchical data. Each <code>parameter.part</code> can be used to encode
    discrete elements of the non-FHIR data structure. This approach provides a
    self-describing format where the parameter names indicate the meaning of each data element.
  </p>
  <p>
    When using Parameters to represent non-FHIR data, care should be taken to ensure that the structure is well-defined
    and consistent across notifications. Clear documentation of the expected parameter names and data types is essential
    for implementers to correctly interpret the non-FHIR content. It is recommended to create a Profile based on the Parameters
    resource to formalize the structure and constraints of the non-FHIR data representation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that there are some challenges regarding filtering when using Parameters as the root resource. Custom Search 
    Parameters can be defined using FHIRPath expressions using navigational functions such as <code>children()</code>
    and <code>descendants()</code>, but care must be taken in the structure to make extraction feasible. It is recommended
    to use <code>parameter.name</code> values that are compatible with FHIR search parameter naming conventions to ease
    mapping between filters and instance content (e.g., no spaces or special characters).
  </p>
  <p>
    Authors are encouraged to keep in mind that non-FHIR content is not typically in a Parameters format during processing.
    Implementers are likely to map any filtering and triggering logic to the native format of the non-FHIR data instead.

      <li><a href="notification-full-parameters.html">Notification Bundle for a Parameters resource</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <a name="non-fhir-binary"></a>
  <h4>Binary Resources</h4>
  <p>
    A <a href="binary.html">Binary</a> resource can be included in the notification to carry raw non-FHIR content. The Binary 
    resource supports any content type via <code>Binary.contentType</code> and includes the data as base64-encoded content in 
    <code>Binary.data</code>. This approach is suitable when the non-FHIR data is a single blob of content (e.g., a PDF 
    document, an HL7v2 message, a proprietary format).
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that Search Parameters are not expected to be defined for Binary content, so any filtering needs to be expressed
    against the non-FHIR content directly. This can make defining computable filters more challenging, and authors are 
    encouraged to consider if other representations (e.g., Logical Models, Basic, or Parameters) might be more suitable if 
    filtering is a key requirement.

  <a name="triggers-vs-filters" />
  <h3>Triggers vs. Filters</h3>
  <p>
    Subscription Topics contain two sets of evaluation criteria - one set as part of triggers (i.e.,
    <code>trigger</code>) and the other as part of filters (i.e., <code>trigger.canFilterBy</code>). Triggers are the
    tests used to generate any notification by any subscription linked to a topic, while filters are the tests used by
    each subscription to differentiate the notifications they are interested in. For example, a topic could be defined
    to trigger for any new <a href="medicationrequest.html">MedicationRequest</a> - this allows server implementers to
    optimize tests at a single point. However, a patient is only interested in medication requests for <i>them</i>,
    which would be represented by a filter (e.g., on <code>MedicationRequest.patient</code>). The set of allowed filters
    are defined by the subscription topic, but actual values for filtering are listed in the <a
      href="subscription.html">Subscription</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This logical separation of triggers and filters exists to limit the complexity of topics. However, this
    specification does not place any architectural requirements on severs regarding the separation of triggers and
    filters. An implementation is free to separate the two portions or combine the tests as desired.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that triggers can be defined in three ways: as part of the conceptual definition, a computable
    <code>trigger</code> (i.e., a FHIRPath or query-based definition), and/or a possibly-computable <code>event</code>
    code. Topics without computable definitions are not expected to trigger unless a server has explicitly added support
    for them. For example, a trigger could be based on a complex set of criteria that is difficult to express or depend
    on information not available in a FHIR context (e.g., user information). Servers can implement these topics, but
    they require software changes and cannot be expected to trigger notifications generally. Servers that support the
    <code>create</code> interaction on <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> MAY reject resources that do not include
    computable definitions or depend on mechanisms the implementation does not support.
  </p>

  <a name="resource-operation-pairs" />
  <h3>Triggers and Resource Interactions</h3>
  <p>
    Subscription Topics based on Resource Interactions are simple to describe - definitions include the resource type
    (e.g., <code>Patient</code>, <code>Encounter</code>) and the interaction of interest (e.g., <code>create</code>,
    <code>delete</code>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Subscription Topics for resource interactions are defined using the <code>SubscriptionTopic.trigger.resource</code>
    and <code>SubscriptionTopic.trigger.supportedInteraction</code> elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a topic is designed to cover multiple resources, it can contain multiple <code>trigger</code> elements with each
    resource. If a topic is generic to all resources, the <code>Resource</code> is available within the <a
      href="valueset-fhir-types.html">FHIR Type</a> value set.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that <code>supportedInteraction</code> filters can be used either alone, resulting in notifications for every
    time a resource has the interaction (e.g., every <code>create</code>), or with <code>queryCriteria</code> or
    <code>fhirPathCriteria</code>. When one or more supported interactions are defined, criteria SHOULD only be
    evaluated for interactions that are included. For example, a FHIRPath expression designed for resource updates might
    not test for the previous state correctly during create processing.
  </p>

  <a name="resource-trigger-create" />
  <h4>Trigger Interaction: Create</h4>
  <p>
    Subscription Topics that include <code>create</code> interactions are tested each time a resource of the specified
    type is created. If a topic contains no trigger criteria (either query-based or FHIRPath), a notification will be
    generated for every instance created. If criteria are specified, the criteria SHOULD only be evaluated after the
    interaction is confirmed to apply.
  </p>
  <p>
    When using <code>queryCriteria</code> during a create, the <code>previous</code> test does not have a defined
    behavior - there is no resource available to test against. In order to filter correctly, a combination of
    <code>resultForCreate</code> and <code>requireBoth</code> must be specified. For example, setting both
    <code>resultForCreate</code> and <code>requireBoth</code> to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> will result in
    criteria that can be tested against all interactions with expected behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    When using <code>fhirPathCriteria</code> during a create, the <code>%previous</code> variable will be set to empty
    (<code>{}</code>). Authors should ensure that expressions can be evaluated without errors in all applicable
    situations.
  </p>

  <a name="resource-trigger-delete" />
  <h4>Trigger Interaction: Delete</h4>
  <p>
    Subscription Topics that include <code>delete</code> interactions are triggered each time a resource of the
    specified type is deleted. If a topic contains no trigger criteria (either query-based or FHIRPath), a notification
    will be generated for every instance deleted. If criteria are specified, the criteria SHOULD only be evaluated after
    the interaction is confirmed to apply.
  </p>
  <p>
    When using <code>queryCriteria</code> during a delete, the <code>current</code> test does not have a defined
    behavior - there is no resource available to test against. In order to filter correctly, a combination of
    <code>resultForDelete</code> and <code>requireBoth</code> must be specified. For example, setting both
    <code>resultForDelete</code> and <code>requireBoth</code> to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> will result in
    criteria that can be tested against all interactions with expected behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    When using <code>fhirPathCriteria</code> during a delete, the <code>%current</code> variable will be set to empty
    (<code>{}</code>). Authors should ensure that expressions can be evaluated without errors in all applicable
    situations.
  </p>

  <a name="resource-trigger-update" />
  <h4>Trigger Interaction: Update</h4>
  <p>
    Subscription Topics that include <code>update</code> interactions are triggered each time the server updates a
    resource of the specified type. Triggering an <code>update</code> operation does not imply that the resource has
    changes visible to the subscriber, nor does it require servers to monitor resources for actual changes. Servers MAY
    generate notifications on their internal triggers, regardless of actual changes (e.g., a client issuing an HTTP PUT
    with an identical resource).
  </p>
  <p>
    When using <code>queryCriteria</code> during an update, both the <code>previous</code> and <code>current</code>
    tests can apply. In most cases, an update should set <code>requireBoth</code> and ensure that the elements of
    interest are the ones changed to avoid generating notifications on unrelated updates. For example, if a topic is
    looking for changes to <code>Encounter.status</code>, only checking that the <code>current</code> status is
    <code>in-progress</code> would trigger notifications on changes to the <code>Encounter.diagnosis</code> for an
    in-progress encounter.
  </p>
  <p>
    When using <code>fhirPathCriteria</code> during an update, it is recommended to test both the <code>%previous</code>
    and <code>%current</code> contents to ensure that only desired changes are captured. For example, if a topic is
    looking for changes to <code>Encounter.status</code>, only checking that the <code>%current</code> status is
    <code>in-progress</code> would trigger notifications on changes to the <code>Encounter.diagnosis</code> for an
    in-progress encounter.
  </p>

  <a name="resource-value-tests" />
  <h3>Resource Value Tests</h3>
  <p>
    If a topic requires more granularity than interactions provide, a topic can provide state-change tests using either
    <a href="fhirpath.html">FHIRPath</a> or query (<a href="search.html">Search</a>) definitions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Computable Definitions serve two purposes when defining topics. First, some server implementers may be able to use
    computable definitions directly or with minimal changes. In this scenario, the benefit of a computable definition is
    quite large (e.g., user-defined Subscription Topics, high portability, etc.). Second, implementers that do not use
    computable definitions directly will be able to read definitions during their implementation in order to precisely
    understand what is being defined.
  </p>

  <a name="query-criteria" />
  <h4>Query (Search) Trigger Definitions</h4>
  <p>
    Query definitions are based on Search evaluations performed before and/or after a state change in the server.
    Allowed query parameters are based on the resource specified in <code>trigger.resource</code> (e.g., if the resource
    is <a href="encounter.html">Encounter</a>, the list of available search parameters can be found on the <a
      href="encounter.html#search">Encounter Resource page</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Because FHIR search expressions are evaluated against a single resource, <code>queryCriteria</code> provides two
    elements for including criteria - <code>previous</code> for an expression tested against the resource as it existed
    before the current interaction and <code>current</code> for an expression tested against the resource as it exists
    after the current interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    When using query criteria, it is important to note the interaction between the <code>supportedInteraction</code>
    element, the <code>previous</code> and <code>resultForCreate</code> elements, the <code>current</code> and
    <code>resultForDelete</code> elements, and the <code>requireBoth</code> element. More information can be found in
    the <a href="#resource-operation-pairs">Triggers and Resource Interactions</a> section of this page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the query strings specified in <code>previous</code> and <code>current</code> are NOT required to be
    URL-encoded. Implementers should be defensive when processing these query criteria and check for both URL-encoded
    and non-URL-encoded forms to ensure compatibility across different implementations.
  </p>

  <a name="fhirpath-criteria" />
  <h4>FHIRPath Trigger Definitions</h4>
  <p>
    FHIRPath expressions can be used to define topical state changes in a server. The FHIRPath expression is assumed to
    be provided the inputs listed below.
  </p>
  <p>
    FHIRPath expression input variables:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Variable <code>%previous</code> - resource instance prior to state change being applied, or <code>{}</code> if no
      previous state exists (e.g., during <code>create</code>)
    </li>
    <li>
      Variable <code>%current</code> - resource instance post state change being applied, or <code>{}</code> if no
      current state exists (e.g., during <code>delete</code>)
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, the expression: <code>%previous.status!='in-progress' and %current.status='in-progress'</code>
    indicates that the resource has an element, <code>status</code>, and that notifications are generated if the
    pre-update version status is not 'in-progress' and the post-update version is 'in-progress'.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the resource trigger includes a <code>supportedInteraction</code> filter, the FHIRPath expression SHALL only be
    tested for the listed interactions. Note that empty-checking must be included in a FHIRPath test if the test
    includes properties that do not exist for interactions included in the trigger. To continue with the above example,
    if the test should be applied to <code>create</code> interactions in addition to <code>update</code> ones, a more
    complete expression would be:
    <code>(%previous.empty() | (%previous.status != 'in-progress')) and (%current.status = 'in-progress')</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When using FHIRPath criteria, it is important to note the interaction between the <code>supportedInteraction</code>
    element and the <code>%previous</code> and <code>%current</code> variables. More information can be found in the <a
      href="#resource-operation-pairs">Triggers and Resource Interactions</a> section of this page.
  </p>

  <a name="definition-event" />
  <h3>Event Trigger Definitions</h3>
  <p>
    There are use-cases when a triggering event is not easily described in terms of FHIR resources (e.g., shift change
    at a facility) or that an existing workflow is already defined on an event-based system (e.g., patient admission in
    HL7v2). To support these scenarios Subscription Topics MAY include an event trigger, either instead of or in
    addition to resource triggers. As with other types of trigger definitions, implementers have discretion on whether
    to support event trigger or not - the inclusion of an event definition in a trigger does not imply support within a
    server.
  </p>
  <p>
    Event triggers are straightforward to define, since most of the definition exists in the event. The <a
      href="subscriptiontopic-definitions.html#SubscriptionTopic.trigger.event">event</a> element references the event
    which causes a Subscription to trigger. For example, using the event
    <code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0003#A01</code> indicates that a Subscription activates under the
    same conditions that a HL7v2 system would send an <code>ADT^A01</code> message. Similarly, an event trigger using
    <code>http://fhircast.org/events/patient-open</code> indicates that a Subscription activates under the same
    conditions that a FHIRcast Hub generates a <code>patient-open</code> message.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to allow Subscriptions to easily filter event-based topic definitions, event definitions require a "root"
    FHIR resource that can be referenced. This is defined in the <a
      href="subscriptiontopic-definitions.html#SubscriptionTopic.trigger.resource">trigger.resource</a> element. For
    example, a HL7v2 patient admission event (<code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0003#A01</code>) would
    likely be rooted in an Encounter resource, while a FHIRcast patient open event
    (<code>http://fhircast.org/events/patient-open</code>) would likely be rooted in a Patient resource. By establishing
    the appropriate root resource for an event, topics can expose filters that are appropriate for notifications. If
    there is no logical resource available (e.g., events referencing non-FHIR events), resources such as <a
      href="parameters.html">Parameters</a> or <a href="basic.html">Basic</a> are available. Note that it is not
    required to use a FHIR resource in this context, but use of non-FHIR-core structures (e.g., Logical Models) or
    non-FHIR definitions (e.g., a CDS Hook definition) limit access to standard filters. Topics can define filters
    in-line to enable filtering, but authors need to keep in mind additional implementation complexity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that while having a conceptual description and linking to an event is sufficient for a definition, authors are
    encouraged to include computable triggers if possible.
  </p>

  <a name="filters" />
  <h3>Defining Allowed Filters</h3>
  <p>
    To help servers filter a large set of topic notifications into a smaller set of events that a particular client is
    interested in, each <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> defines a set of filters that clients are allowed to request. For
    example, filters can be used to allow a <code>Subscription</code> to narrow down notifications from a topic defining
    all patient admissions to a just admissions for patients for a specific care team.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that filters can be defined either to a single resource type (e.g., <code>Patient</code>) or to the
    'lower-level' resource types (e.g., <code>Resource</code>). When defining allowed filters across resources, care
    should be taken to ensure that the parameters correctly apply to all resources included in scope. For example, a
    filter defined for <code>Resource</code> has well-defined behavior for search parameters like <a
      href="search.html#_language">_language</a>, <a href="search.html#_source">_source</a>, and <a
      href="search.html#_tag">_tag</a>, but there is not a well-defined behavior for a parameter like <a
      href="searchparameter-registry.html#clinical-patient">patient</a> across resources that are not in the patient
    compartment. Servers MAY reject subscriptions requests that are include too broad filters, determine at the time of
    creation which resources the parameter is applied to, or test each resource at runtime. More information is
    available on the <a href="subscriptions.html#resource-filters">Subscriptions Framework</a> page.
  </p>

  <a name="filters-param-name" />
  <h4>Filter Parameter</h4>
  <p>
    The element <code>canFilterBy.filterParameter</code> contains the name of a parameter used to filter events for the
    focus resource. The name used in this element is only valid in the context of the Subscription Topic.
  </p>
  <p>
    The filter parameter MAY be a Search Parameter, either from the list of <a href="search.html#Summary">Parameters for
      all resources</a> (e.g., <code>_id</code>, <code>_tag</code>) or Search Parameter defined for a specific resource
    (e.g., <a href="encounter.html#search">Encounter Search Parameters</a>, <a href="patient.html#search">Patient search
      parameters</a>, etc.). When a Search Parameter is used, the topic SHALL contain a reference to a valid canonical
    definition in the <code>canFilterBy.filterDefinition</code> element.
  </p>
  <p>
    The filter parameter MAY be a filter defined in the context of a topic. When a parameter is defined by a topic, the
    <code>canFilterBy.filterDefinition</code> SHOULD point to a URL containing detailed information about the parameter
    - e.g., datatype of the parameter.
  </p>

  <a name="filter-param-definition" />
  <h4>Filter Definition</h4>
  <p>
    Filters MAY have external definitions. For example, Search Parameters defined in the FHIR Specifications have
    canonical URLs in the format of <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/[id]</code> (see <a
      href="searchparameter-registry.html">Search Parameter Registry</a>). with Search Parameters, it is possible that
    two externally-defined filters share the same "short" name. In these cases, the URI contained in the
    <code>filterDefinition</code> element is used to link a context-local name for the parameter
    (<code>filterParameter</code>) to the complete definition.
  </p>
  <p>
    As described in <a href="#filters-param-name">Filter Parameter</a>, parameters backed by full Search Parameter
    definitions SHALL contain a link to the canonical URL in this element and other parameters SHOULD contain a useful
    URI in this element.
  </p>

  <a name="filters-comparator" />
  <a name="filters-modifier" />
  <h4>Comparators and Modifiers</h4>
  <p>
    In addition to the element or elements for a filter, sometimes it is necessary to describe additional behavior used
    in the filtering tests (e.g., asking for values in a range). To specify this, filters can specify
    <code>comparator</code> and <code>modifier</code> values, matching the behaviors defined by <a
      href="searchparameter.html">SearchParameters</a>. Details about interactions with element types can be found on
    the search page, in the <a href="search.html#modifiers">Modifiers</a> and <a href="search.html#prefix">Prefixes</a>
    sections.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note:
  <ul>
    <li>If no <code>comparator</code> or <code>modifier</code> is provided, the comparison is the default <code>=</code>
      match.</li>
    <li>If a filter parameter is a defined Search Parameter, the list of allowed modifiers SHALL be a strict subset of
      the modifiers defined on the Search Parameter.</li>
    <li>While filters may allow both, no single filter value allowed to have both a <code>comparator</code> and a
      <code>modifier</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <a name="filters-event" />
  <h4>Filters on Event Triggers</h4>
  <p>
    On implementations that support event-based filtering, Subscriptions are able to directly filter based on event
    triggers defined in the <code>SubscriptionTopic</code>. See <a
      href="subscription-definitions.html#Subscription.filterBy.event">Subscription.filterBy.event</a> for more details
    on usage.
  </p>

  <a name="filters-timing" />
  <h4>Filter Timing and Interactions</h4>
  <p>
    When a server evaluates filters depends on the type of change covered by the topic. Guidance is provided based on
    implementation feedback, but note that all filters are defined to explicitly describe the state before and after the
    interaction occurs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that while the <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> resource defines filters that can be exposed to clients, actual
    filters and their values are specified by the <a href="subscription.html">Subscription</a> resource.
  </p>

  <a name="filters-timing-create" />
  <h5>Filters on Create Interactions</h5>
  <p>
    Logically, subscription filters evaluated against <code>create</code> interactions must be performed after the
    resource has been created. For example, a topic interested in new patients may allow filters on elements within the
    patient resource (e.g., new patients in a specified age range).
  </p>

  <a name="filters-timing-delete" />
  <h5>Filters on Delete Interactions</h5>
  <p>
    Logically, query filters evaluated against <code>delete</code> interactions must be performed before the resource
    has been deleted. For example, a topic interested in practitioners being removed may allow filters on the
    practitioner resource (e.g., removed practitioners with a specific qualification).
  </p>

  <a name="filters-timing-update" />
  <h5>Filters on Update Interactions</h5>
  <p>
    Logically, query filters evaluated against <code>update</code> interactions MAY be performed either before or after
    the update occurs. For clarity, it is recommended that a topic does not define filters for the same resource
    elements being test for the notification triggers. For example, if a topic is looking for changes on the
    <code>Encounter.status</code> element, a filter for that element would always have different values in the two
    states. If a topic requires a filter on one of the elements present in the triggers, the author SHOULD explain in
    the topic definition when filters should be applied.
  </p>

  <a name="notification-shape" />
  <h3>Notification Shape</h3>
  <p>
    In addition to the triggering information for a topic, this resource also defines the expected 'shape' of
    notifications via <code>notificationShape</code>. Each shape is defined according to a resource via the
    <code>trigger.notificationShape.resource</code> element. This is the 'focus' resource of the topic, or one of them
    if there are more than one, and the root resource for that shape definition. It will be the same, a generality, or a
    specificity of <code>trigger.resource</code> when it is present.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that multiple <code>notificationShape</code> elements can exist for the same resource, so that a server can
    indicate that there are multiple groupings of resources that may be sent. For example, a business-to-business (B2B)
    topic may include notifications on all changes to Patient resources, but may want to define that sometimes a Patient
    will include Encounters and other times Conditions.
  </p>

  <a name="shape-root-resource" />
  <h4>Root Resource</h4>
  <p>
    The element <code>notificationShape.resource</code> defines a 'root' resource for notifications. Typically, this
    resource will be the same as the triggering resource (e.g., <code>trigger.resource</code>), however there may be
    situations where this is not the case. For example, a topic may be defined across all resources (e.g., every time a
    resource is deleted), but the author may want additional information depending on which resource is involved. In
    that scenario, the <code>trigger.resource</code> could be set to <code>Resource</code> to trigger on all resources,
    with shapes defined for each resource in the patient compartment to include patient information with those
    notifications (e.g., if an <code>Encounter</code> is deleted, include the <code>Patient</code> record as well). Note
    that the opposite scenario is also supported - an author may define multiple triggers on different types of events
    and simply define a shape that is valid for all of those resources.
  </p>

  <a name="shape-additional-resources" />
  <h4>Including Additional Resources</h4>
  <p>
    Sometimes it is beneficial to include additional resources with a subscription notification. For example, queries
    for additional resources may be complex in the future, but simple at the time of notification due to context in the
    event. Alternatively, the subscriber may have limited ability to request additional resource (e.g., a client that is
    generally offline).
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to facilitate these workflows, a SubscriptionTopic can define additional resources that MAY be included
    when a notification is sent. These additions are based off of the focus resource of the notification, and are
    described as a list of <a href="search.html#include">_include and _revinclude</a> directives. When notifications are
    generated, a server SHOULD check the appropriate <code>notificationShape.resource</code> for a matching resource and
    SHOULD include any additional resources listed via <code>notificationShape.include</code> and
    <code>notificationShape.revInclude</code>, if they exist and the user context for the subscription is authorized to
    access them. Clients SHOULD be prepared to receive these additional resources, but SHALL function properly without
    them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Inclusion directives MAY contain additional logic as allowed by search (e.g., iterating over inclusions). Server
    implementations are under no obligation to support additional logic, just as they are not required to support shape
    directives. Servers that do support inclusions but not support complex inclusion logic SHOULD ignore the additional
    directives in the <code>include</code> and <code>revinclude</code> elements. Note that there is currently no
    discovery mechanism for advertising or finding the level of shaping support for a server. Server implementers SHOULD
    document their support so that client implementers can discover this out-of-band.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the <a href="subscriptiontopic-example.html">SubscriptionTopic/example</a> example, the focus resource is <a
      href="encounter.html">Encounter</a> and lists several resources to include. The first inclusion,
    <code>Encounter:patient&amp;iterate=Patient.link</code> requests that patients related to the encounter are included
    <i>and</i> that the server should follow the <code>Patient.link</code> element to include patients or related
    persons listed there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Included resources SHOULD be added in the same style as the focus resource - e.g., if notifications are
    <code>id-only</code>, then included resources should only include their ids as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the FHIR specification defines other mechanisms for defining graphs of resources - e.g., <a
      href="http://build.fhir.org/HL7/api-incubator/StructureDefinition-GraphDefinition">GraphDefinition</a> and <a href="graphql.html">GraphQL</a>. Currently, adoption of
    these mechanisms is significantly behind implementations of Search-based include. In order to support this
    functionality without adding barriers to implementing subscriptions, support for <code>include</code> and
    <code>revinclude</code> was selected. If another graph-defining mechanism gains widespread adoption, support could
    be added via an extension with changes to this resource in a future version of FHIR.
  </p>

  <a name="shape-related-query" />
  <h4>Including Related Queries</h4>
  <p>
    It can be beneficial to send queries to a subscriber either in addition to or instead of other contents in a
    notification (e.g., resource ids or resource contents). For example, when referrals for services that may be
    scheduled far into the future or when notifying of complex or non-standardized sets of information (e.g., insurance
    coverage).
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to facilitate these workflows, a SubscriptionTopic can define a set of queries that MAY be included when a
    notification is sent. These queries are described as a list of <a href="search.html">Search Queries</a> and optional
    coded information about the query (i.e., what information it provides). The queries included in a SubscriptionTopic
    are not required to be fully-resolvable, but rather a starting point or template for specific queries that are
    included in notifications. When notifications are generated, a server that supports this feature SHOULD include
    queries listed via <code>notificationShape.relatedQuery</code> if they exist and the workflow is one that can
    reasonably expect subscribers to be able to execute the queries. Note that support for including queries is optional
    and servers are not required to implement this functionality. Clients SHOULD be prepared to receive these queries,
    but SHALL function properly without them.
  </p>

  <a name="deriving" />
  <h2>Deriving from existing Subscription Topics</h2>
  <p>
    By populating the <a href="subscriptiontopic-definitions.html#SubscriptionTopic.derivedFrom">derivedFrom</a>
    element, implementers can advertise that a new topic is compatible with, and offers additional features on top of,
    another Subscription Topic. A derived topic can add additional filters, but cannot remove existing ones nor change
    the 'concept' of a topic during derivation. For example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deriving a new SubscriptionTopic with the same concept but a different computable definition is OK.</li>
    <li>Deriving a new SubscriptionTopic to expose additional canFilterBy parameters is OK.</li>
    <li>Deriving a new SubscriptionTopic to remove an existing canFilterBy parameter is NOT ok.</li>
    <li>Deriving a new SubscriptionTopic based on a different resource than its parent is NOT ok (e.g., start/end of
      medication derived from encounter).</li>
  </ul>
