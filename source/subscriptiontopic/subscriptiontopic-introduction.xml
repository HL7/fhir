  <h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> resource is used to define conceptual or computable events for <a href="subscription.html">Subscription</a> resources.  A <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> defines the <b>data</b> and <b>change</b> of interest, as well as allowed <b>filters</b> so that servers can implement specific functionality around subscriptions and clearly communicate boundaries to clients.  In other words, a <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> is a way of describing a state change to know what is of interest.  Because it describes a state change, a <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> is typically defined by either a resource-operation pair or value criteria tested against the previous and current states.
  </p>
  <p>
    Subscription Topics are intended to be discoverable, reusable, and extensible.  Definitions should be computably defined whenever possible, but the conceptual definition is the arbiter between any discrepancies.  For example, a query-based and a FHIRPath-based definition may differ slightly because of what is expressable in each language.  In such cases, the goal is correct implmentation of the concept - not literal translations between computable definitions.

    This document contains information about the <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> resource and details specific to options in it.  See <a href="subscriptions.html">Subscriptions</a> for general information about using Subscriptions in FHIR.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> represents a well-defined concept to both a client and a server.  These concepts fall under several categories:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Concept Definition - e.g., Start of a Clinical Encounter, New Observation
      </li>
      <li>
        Resource Operation Pairs - e.g., <code>create</code> on <code>Observation</code> resources
      </li>
      <li>
        Resource Value Tests - e.g., Encounter:<code>%previous.status!='in-progress' and %current.status='in-progress'</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> resource is used in the <a href="subscriptions.html">Subscriptions Framework</a>.  Information about the Boundaries and Relationships both within the Subscriptions Framework and to other areas of the FHIR specification can be found <a href="subscriptions.html#bnr">here</a>.
