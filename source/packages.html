<p>
FHIR Specifications are published in HTML format for human consumption, and as NPM packages for machine consumption.
</p>
<p>
Some important packages for FHIR Implementers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>hl7.fhir.rX.core</code>: The package that contains the definitions found in the base specification</li>
  <li><code>hl7.fhir.rX.examples</code>: The package that contains the example resources found in the base specification</li>
  <li><code>hl7.terminology</code>: The package that contains all the code systems and value sets maintained by HL7 for all standards it publishes</li>
</ul>

<h3>FHIR NPM Packages</h3>
<p>
Each FHIR package is a tarball (tar in gzip) that contains a <code>package</code> folder that 
contains:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a package.json file that describes the package</li>
  <li>0 or more FHIR resources in <a href="json.html">JSON</a> format</li>
  <li>0 or more FHIR resources in an <code>examples</code> folder below the package folder that contains 
      examples in <a href="json.html">JSON</a> format for the profiles included </li>
  <li>an .index.json file in both folders that contains key information from the JSON resources for quick access</li>
</ul>
<p>
Packages may contain additional folders below the <code>package</code> folder and files but their use is not defined
by this specification. 
</p>
<p>
Note that this specification is published as a package,
and each <a href="implementationguide.html">Implementation Guide</a> is 
published as a package, but this is not the only use for package, and other 
packages exist.
</p>
<h3>package.json</h3>
<p>
The format of the package.json file is defined by the 
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json">NPM Package Specification</a>.
This specification makes some rules about use of the properties as defined in the NPM 
specification, and defines some additional FHIR specific properties.
</p>
<table class="grid">
  <tr>
    <td>name</td>
    <td>required</td>
    <td>Each package SHALL have globally unique identifier for the package in the NPM System.
      A package name consists of two or more namespaces separated by a dot. Each namespace starts with a lowercase alphabet character followed by zero-or-more lowercase alphanumeric characters or dashes.
      The first part of the namespace should identify the publisher
      for the package.

<h3>Example Package File</h3>

<p>
This is the package.json file to the US Core Implementation Guide.
</p>
<pre class="json">
  {
    "name": "hl7.fhir.us.core",
    "version": "5.0.1",
    "type": "IG",
    "date": "20220622194452",
    "license": "CC0-1.0",
    "canonical": "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core",
    "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU5.0.1",
    "title": "US Core Implementation Guide",
    "description": "The US Core Implementation Guide...",
    "dependencies": {
      "hl7.fhir.r4.core": "4.0.1",
      "hl7.terminology.r4": "3.1.0",
      "hl7.fhir.uv.bulkdata": "2.0.0",
      "hl7.fhir.uv.smart-app-launch": "2.0.0",
      "us.nlm.vsac": "0.7.0",
      "hl7.fhir.uv.sdc": "3.0.0"
    },
    "author": "HL7 International - Cross-Group Projects",
    "jurisdiction": "urn:iso:std:iso:3166#US"
  }
</pre>

<h3>.index.json</h3>
<p>
This optional file contains information from the resources in the package
folder. The intention of this file is to save tools from loading 
every resource in the package; they can read the .index.json file 
and know what resources are in the package and load only the ones
they need.
</p>
<p>
Note that there is no independent information in the .index.json file;
all the information is derived from the resources, and tools can 
rebuild it at any time (or built it and add it if it is not present).
</p>
<pre class="json">
{
  "index-version": 2,
  "files": [
  ]
}
</pre>
<p>
The index version is a fixed value that may change if this file format
is changed. Tools should rebuild the file if they do not recognise
the version. The files array contains an object for each resource 
in the package with the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>filename - the filename in the package directory that is being described</li>
  <li>resourceType</li>
  <li>id</li>
  <li>url</li>
  <li>version</li>
  <li>kind</li>
  <li>type</li>
  <li>supplements</li>
  <li>content</li>
</ul>
<p>
These properties are populated if there is a string property with
the same name in the resource identified by the filename, irrespective
of resource type.
</p>

<h3>FHIR NPM Package Registry</h3>
<p>
For user convenience, tools may choose 
to use a <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Package+Cache">common local cache</a>.
</p>

<h3>FHIR NPM Package Registry</h3>
<p>
The FHIR packages are all hosted on the registry <a href="http://packages.fhir.org">http://packages.fhir.org</a>.
Users can <a href="https://registry.fhir.org/">search for packages</a> and download them manually, but the 
main users of the registry are tools that access the registry 
using <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/firely/Simplifier.net_FHIR_Package_API">the package API</a>.
A secondary package registry may be found at <a href="http://packages2.fhir.org">http://packages2.fhir.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
To load a package onto the package servers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Publish the package at a known place on the web</li>
  <li>Register the package in an rss feed. Use <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/package-feed.xml">http://hl7.org/fhir/package-feed.xml</a> as a template</li>
  <li>Register the rss feed in the master list of package feeds at <a href="https://github.com/FHIR/ig-registry/blob/master/package-feeds.json">https://github.com/FHIR/ig-registry/blob/master/package-feeds.json</a>. Make the change via a Git PR</li>
  <li>The package registries crawl the registered feeds looking for new packages on a regular basis</li>
</ul>
