<h2>Workflow Considerations</h2>
<p>
For some SupplyDelivery instances there is a specific need to articulate if the event represents a dispatch or receipt, due to unique traceability requirements inherent to some transported products. This is particularly true when dispatch and receipt occurs across organizational boundaries with each party only having their "half" of the conversation. SupplyDelivery can be used for these events through the use of the <code>SupplyDelivery.stage</code> element.
</p>
<p>
Example scenario using the resource:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A hospital transfusion laboratory places a SupplyRequest order for blood stock replenishment. The order is for 40 x O+ red blood cells, 35 x A+ red cells, 10 x O- red cells and 10 x A- red cells.</li>
<li>The community blood bank receives the order and prepares the consignment. A SupplyDelivery representing a dispatch event is created that corresponds to the physical dispatch advice note.</li>
<li>On receipt of the consignment the transfusion laboratory inspects and scans each received unit, and a SupplyDelivery representing the receipt event is created.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Some connected systems would see both instances of the SupplyDelivery events while others would only see the portion their organization is responsible for.
</p>
<p>
It is intended that a delivery and subsequent return would be documented as two different instances of the SupplyDelivery resource. In workflow terms a SupplyDelivery is the response to a SupplyRequest, and in the case of a return, you would still have a SupplyRequest initiating that return. The SupplyDelivery instances represent one or more distinct stages of the response to a SupplyRequest from beginning to end, and receiving the product (even if you will ultimately ship it back) is a terminal event.
