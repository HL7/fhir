<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p><strong>This resource is an <em>event</em> resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a>.   It is the intent of the Orders and Observation Workgroup to align this resource with  the workflow pattern for <a href="workflow.html#event"><em>event</em> resources</a>.</strong></p>
<p>
The scope of the supply resource is for supplies used in the healthcare process.  This includes supplies specifically
used in the treatment of patients as well as supply movement within an institution (transport a set of supplies from 
materials management to a service unit (nurse station).  This resource does not include the provisioning of transportation
services.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
This resource overlaps with others such as <a href="devicedispense.html">DeviceDispense</a> and <a href="medicationdispense.html">Medicationdispense</a>. 
The <b>SupplyDelivery</b> resource may be used for medications, biologically derived products, and devices when handling them generically (as any other supply). 
For example, when processing bulk orders, etc. However, when the medication, biologically derived product, device or other aspects of the resource are important, 
(e.g. in a <a href="medicationrequest.html">MedicationRequest</a> or when identifying a device as a performer), the more detailed resource must be used.
</p>

<p>
To determine the purchase date, a search of DeviceRequest, SupplyRequest, DeviceDispense, or SupplyDelivery as defined in an implementation guide can be done , as the context of the use case actually determines which date of either resource is considered the purchase date.
