<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The scope of the supply resource is for supplies used in the healthcare process.  This includes supplies specifically
used in the treatment of patients as well as supply movement within an institution (transport a set of supplies from 
materials management to a service unit (nurse station).  This resource does not include the provisioning of transportation
services.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
This resource overlaps with others such as <a href="device.html">Device</a> and <a href="medication.html">Medication</a>.
The <b>Supply</b> resource may be used to describe medications and devices when handling them generically (as any other supply).  For
example, when processing bulk orders, etc.  However, when the medication, device or other aspects of the resource are important,
(e.g. in a <a href="medicationprescription.html">MedicationPrescription</a> or when identifying a device as a performer), the
more detailed resource must be used.
