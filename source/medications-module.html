<h2>Medications Module</h2>

<a name="intro"> </a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This module is concerned with resources and functionality in 2 main domains:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The ordering, supply, administration and recording of medications</li>
	<li>Recording of Immunizations given (or not given), and recommendations for an individual patient at a point in time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Resources</h3>



<table class="grid">
	<tr><td>Resource</td><td>Purpose</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Medications</strong></td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><a href="medicationorder.html">MedicationOrder</a></td>
		<td>
		<p>Represents an instruction for the administration of medication to a patient - both in the inpatient (hospital) and
		community setting. It can also include instructions for the dispensing, the reasons why the administration should
		occur and other data.</p>
		<p>It is called an 'Order' to be consistent with other FHIR resources, but a common alias for this resource is a 'Prescription'.
		The Order itself represents the content of the instruction and is not, by itself, actionable. The workflow process
		around 'fulfilling' the order is part of the <a href="workflow-module.html">generic FHIR workflow</a> (see below),
			with the MedicationOrder representing the contents.</p>

	</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="medicationdispense.html">MedicationDispense</a></td>
		<td>The provision of a supply of a medication with the intention that it is subsequently consumed by a patient
			(usually in response to a prescription).</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="medicationadministration.html">MedicationAdministration</a></td>
		<td>A record of a patient actually consuming a medicine, or if it has otherwise been administered to them</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="medicationstatement.html">MedicationStatement</a></td>
		<td>This is a record of a medication being taken
		by a patient or that a medication has been given to a patient, where the record is the result of a report from the
		patient or another clinician. A medication statement is not a part of the prescribe->dispense->administer sequence,
		but is a report that such a sequence (or at least a part of it) did take place, resulting in a belief that the patient
		has received a particular medication. It is commonly used in constructing a patients 'Current Medications' list.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="medication.html">Medication</a></td>
		<td>The medication resource represents an actual medication that can be given to a patient, and referenced by the
			other medication resources. In many cases, this resource is not needed and the drug is indicated by
		 a reference to the appropriate terminology and so can be represented using a codeable concept. In other cases however,
		it may be desired to indicate more details than the simple drug (such as the packaging, whether it is a generic medication
			or the active and inactive ingredients)
		and so the Medication resource can be used for this.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><strong>Immunisations</strong></td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="immunization.html">Immunization</a></td>
		<td>The Immunization resource is intended to cover the recording of current and historical administration of vaccines
			to patients across all healthcare disciplines in all care settings and all regions.
			This includes immunization of both humans and animals, but does not include the administration of non-vaccine agents,
			even those that may have or claim to have immunological effects.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="immunizationrecommendation.html">ImmunizationRecommendation</a></td>
		<td>A patient's point-in-time immunization and recommendation (i.e. forecasting a patient's immunization eligibility
			according to a published schedule) with optional supporting justification</td></tr>

</table>

<h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Placing a medication Order (aka Prescription). The MedicationOrder resource itself is a record of what is to be
		given to the patient - not an actual instruction to do so. This is actioned using the common
		<a href="workflow-module.html">workflow functionality</a> .
	</li>
	<li>Listing a patients current medications. This is represented using the <a href="list.html">List</a> resource, which allows an author
		to construct a 'curated' list. This has features beyond a simple collection of resources - such as the ability
		to state that the patient is not currently taking any medications at the time that the list is constructed,
		or changes that are made at a point in time (sometimes called medicine reconciliation). FHIR defines a number of specific
		<a href="lifecycle.html#lists">functional lists</a> for this purpose, and a specific
		<a href="list-operations.html#find">operation</a> to retrieve it. Note that FHIR does not describe how the
		list should be maintained by the individual system, as that will vary widely between implementations.
	</li>
	<li>Retrieving a list of Immunizations. This can be achieved using a <a href="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/http.html#search">simple query</a>
		against the <a href="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/immunization.html">Immunization</a> resource type. Note that an Immunization resource can specifically state that it was not given,
		as well as any reactions that occurred. Note that if the reaction is considered to be an indication of an allergy
		or intolerance, then a separate <a href="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/allergyintolerance.html">AllergyIntolerance</a>  resource should be created.
	</li>
	<li>Retrieving recommendations for a specific patient at a point in time. The recommendation for immunizations to give
		would be represented by an ImmunizationRecommendation resource, but the determination of that recommendation is a
		part of <a href="clinicalreasoning-module.html">Decision Support</a>, with the actual immunization schedule being represented by a generic
		<a href="plandefinition.html">Plan Definition</a>, individual <a href="careplan.html">Care Plan</a> or some other record.

	</li>


</ul>

<h3>Other resources</h3>
	There are other resources that are of particular interest in the medication domain.
	<ul>
		<li> <a href="supplyrequest.html">SupplyRequest</a> and <a href="supplydelivery.html">SupplyDelivery</a> which,
		like MedicationOrder, are 'detail' resources used as part of <a href="workflow-module.html">workflow</a>workflow. They are concerned with
			the request of supplies used in the healthcare process. This includes supplies specifically used in the
			treatment of patients as well as supply movement within an institution
			(transport a set of supplies from materials management to a service unit (nurse station).</li>

	</ul>

<h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
<p>
	As with all clinical data, Medications (in particular) can be sensitive information as specific medications can indicate
	the presence of private information such as mental health disorders or HIV. However, withholding information about what
	medications a person is taking can lead to catastrophic results, and so needs to be considered very carefully. At the least,
	a clinician should be made aware that there is information available that they have not been given when making clinical decisions.
