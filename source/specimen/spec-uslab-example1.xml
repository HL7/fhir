  Narrative: A male child of age 3 is taken by his aunt, who is his legal guardian, to be seen by a physician. The child has his blood tested for blood lead. A  Whole blood sample  is taken from arm.. The specimen collection date is 6/15/2012; date of result is 6/17/2012. Both his medical record ID and SSN are included in the patient information along with name, DOB, race/ethnicity, current and home address, and his aunt's business, home and mobile phone number and email address. The lab result is a blood lead level by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) of 9.2 ug/dL and the jurisdiction threshold is 5.0 (reference range of 0.0-5.0). This results in an abnormal flag of “High”. University Hospital has an on-site lab and results blood level tests under the performing lab name of “Acme Labs”. These results are sent to the local public health agency.

	<!--
   Type is a loosely defined field because there is such a lot of variation in how it is used.
   The principal variation is how much information that could be represented elsewhere is also 
   represented here. For instance, here's some possible types:
     lithium heparin plasma   (+ .container.additive) (e.g. SNOMED CT 446272009)
     transfusion bag of blood (+ container.type) 
     Peritoneal lavage        (+ collection.sourceSite)
   If the type includes other fields, it would be normal not to populate the other fields

   Note that this practice is so widespread that it's pointless to try and stop it  :( -->
