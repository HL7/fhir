<h2>
Notes:
</h2>
<ul>
 <li>The CapabilityStatement2 resource provides for an application to describe its use of the RESTful
  paradigm messaging events, or FHIR documents. Usually, an application would only describe one, 
  but more than one may be described</li>
 <li>RESTful CapabilityStatement2 rules:
  <ul class="dense">
   <li>RESTful servers are required to provide <a href="http.html#capabilities">this resource on demand</a>. 
   Servers SHALL specify what resource types and operations are supported, and SHOULD also 
   specify profiles for each resource type.</li>
   <li>The CapabilityStatement2 returned on demand may represent the specific capabilities granted to a specific user if retrieved with that specific user's credentials, if one is in context. Servers that require authentication SHOULD still return a CapabilityStatemnt before authentication/authorization is performed</li>
   <li>RESTful clients SHOULD publish a capability statement</li>
   <li>The search parameters that a server supports (or a client makes use of) are specified in the resource profile that the capability statement references</li>
   <li>Resource Types or operations that are not listed are not supported</li>
  </ul>  
 </li>
 <li>Messaging CapabilityStatement2 rules:
  <ul class="dense">
   <li>The interpretation of request and response depends on the mode. If the mode is sender, 
   then request specifies what the application sends, and response specifies what it accepts. 
   If the mode is "receiver", then this is reversed</li>
   <li>If a request or response is not specified for an event, then no rules are made for it</li>
   <li>Events that are not listed are not supported</li>
   <li>The <a href="messagedefinition.html">MessageDefinition</a> resource is newly proposed and is still considered 'draft'.  
     The <code>supportedMessage</code> element can be used in place of the <code>event</code> and the work group believes it may meet
     implementer needs better, however because the new mechanism has not yet been reviewed by ballot, the older 'event' mechanism has
     been retained.  Implementers may use one or the other to define their capabilities.  Feedback is welcome.</li>
  </ul>  
 </li>
 <li>Document CapabilityStatement2 rules:
  <ul class="dense">
   <li>Document profiles should directly constrain the Document.information.class &amp; type elements so  
    that there is no ambiguity concerning which profile any given document conforms to.</li>
  </ul>  
 </li>
 <li>Other service-based use of resources: Due to the variability of these services, the <code>CapabilityStatement2</code> resource 
   does not attempt to describe service-based use of resources. The various service specifications will need to describe this usage in their own way.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Supporting Profiles</h3>
<a name="tags"></a>
<p>
A CapabilityStatement2 declares two different kinds of profiles for the functionality it describes. 
For a discussion of the use of these two types of resources, see <a href="profiling.html">two uses for profiles</a>.
