  associated with that concept. The best display is the preferred term in the
  relevant language or dialect, as specified in the associated language
  reference set. SNOMED CT synonyms may be case sensitive.
  <br/><br/>SNOMED International does not define terms for expressions. If a SNOMED
  terminology producer publishes human-readable terms for expressions in an
  expression repository, this term may be used as the display. Similarly, if a
  SNOMED terminology producer publishes an official template for generating
  terms from an expression, a term generated using the template may be used as
  the display. If no term or description template has been published, the full
  expression with terms embedded may be used.
  <br/><br/>Note that Display is not intended to contain terms entered by the user
  that have not been officially published by a SNOMED CT Terminology Producer.

<h3>Copyright and Licenses</h3>
<p>
This specification includes content from SNOMED Clinical Terms® (SNOMED CT®) which is copyright of the 
International Health Terminology Standards
Development Organisation (IHTSDO) (trading as SNOMED International). Implementers of these 
specifications must have the appropriate SNOMED CT Affiliate license - for more information contact 
<a href="http://www.snomed.org/snomed-ct/get-snomed-ct">http://www.snomed.org/snomed-ct/get-snomed-ct</a> or 
<a href="mailto:info@snomed.org">info@snomed.org</a>.
</p>

<h3>Versions</h3>
<p>There is no single distribution that contains all
defined SNOMED CT codes in all contexts of use. Instead the
International Edition contains all concepts shared and agreed to be
internationally relevant and each National Release Centre distributes this
International Edition plus additional national content (to extend the
international set). Other release authorities may also be designated. The <a
href="http://snomed.org/uristandard">SNOMED CT URI Specification</a> describes how to
unambiguously reference a particular version of a SNOMED CT edition:</p>
<pre>
  http://snomed.info/sct/[sctid]/version/[YYYYMMDD]
</pre>
<p>where [sctid] is the concept id that identifies the given SNOMED CT edition
(based on the identifier of the most dependent module), and
&quot;YYYYMMDD&quot; is the date of release. Examples of sctids that identify a specific edition
are <a href="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCEXTPG/4.4.2+Edition+URI+Examples">listed here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that many implementations are in the habit of
simply using the date of release in the form YYYYMMDD (e.g. "20140531"),
and assuming that the edition is known. However, this is not always
safe, so implementations that populate the <i>version</i> element
SHOULD use the URI form.
</p><p>
Servers SHOULD regard provision of the date only for the 
version (without an sctid) as an error, and refuse to process the interaction or operation. At minimum the URI SHOULD 
contain the sctid of the SNOMED CT distribution:
</p>
<pre>
http://snomed.info/sct/[sctid]
</pre>
<p>
Implementers must note, if no version URI is provided when utilizing SNOMED CT, the Terminology Service 
may default to the most recent version of the SNOMED CT International Edition available on the service 
(or the latest available of another edition that may be preferred for the locale). Further, if the date 
of release is not provided, the Terminology Service may default to the most recent version of the named 
SNOMED CT distribution (e.g. 32506021000036107 for Australia).
</p>

<p>
In terms of the CodeSystem resource definitions, this means that SNOMED CT is distributed as a 
set of overlapping fragments that contain different parts of the entire code system that is 
SNOMED CT. Terminology servers and users always need to be aware of which fragment(s) are in 
use at any time, though implementations can sometimes safely assume that a national distribution 
is the only scope. Note that because of SNOMED CT's large size, there is no expectation that 
implementers will ever use a CodeSystem resource instead of the SNOMED CT RF2 format 
as a way to distribute SNOMED CT content. 
</p>

<h3>Display Terms for Specific Languages</h3>
<p>
In the ValueSet resource any number of terms 
('<a href="http://build.fhir.org/valueset.html#designations">designations</a>') in additional languages and dialects 
can be specified for a particular concept in a value set definition using the 
<a href="http://build.fhir.org/codesystem-definitions.html#CodeSystem.concept.designation">ValueSet.compose.include.concept.designation</a> 
element. The language is specified as a 
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP-47</a> language code as required by the 
'<a href="http://build.fhir.org/valueset-definitions.html#ValueSet.compose.include.concept.designation.language">designation.language</a>' 
element, with the value taken from the 'languageCode' field of the RF2 Descriptions file ('languageCode' is 
ISO-639-1, a subset of BCP-47). The <a href="http://build.fhir.org/valueset-designation-use.html">type</a> of the 
term (e.g., the SNOMED CT code for "Fully specified name", "Synonym" or "Definition") can be specified in 
'<a href="http://build.fhir.org/valueset-definitions.html#ValueSet.compose.include.concept.designation.use">designation.use</a>'.
</p>
<p>
[Note that ValueSet.compose.include.concept is only used when the value set is defined extensionally (i.e. as an 
enumerated list of concepts).  For intensionally-defined value sets (i.e. using one or more filters) additional 
terms could be added using CodeSystem.concept.designation, as noted below.]
</p>
<p>
The CodeSystem resource can also similarly be used to specify additional terms 
('<a href="http://build.fhir.org/codesystem.html#designations">designations</a>') for a concept using the 
<a href="http://build.fhir.org/codesystem-definitions.html#CodeSystem.concept.designation">CodeSystem.concept.designation</a> 
element (the additional terms may be from a published national or other localized SNOMED CT edition or provided in a 
<a href="http://build.fhir.org/codesystem.html#supplements">code system supplement</a>).  If supported by the 
terminology server, the additional terms are available to be returned in a 
<a href="http://build.fhir.org/valueset.html#expansion">value set expansion</a> (controlled by the 
<a href="http://build.fhir.org/valueset-operation-expand.html#4.8.1.1">$expand</a> operation 'includeDesignations' 
input parameter).
</p>

<h3>SNOMED CT Expressions</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+expression">SNOMED
CT Expression</a> is a structured combination of one or more clinical
concepts, stated using <a href="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCSCG">Compositional Grammar
Syntax</a>.  Expressions may optionally contain display terms.</p>

<h3>RDF</h3>
<p>
The SNOMED International URI specification uses the namespace http://snomed.info/sct for the code system,
and the URI http://snomed.info/id for the individual concepts in the code system. This means
that when a SNOMED CT concept is converted from the system::code pair, where the system is
http://snomed.info/sct, to the <a href="rdf.html">RDF ontological form</a>, the representation is
http://snomed.info/id/[concept-id]. Expressions are represented using the URI pattern http://snomed.info/scg/[expression].
Expressions represented in this way SHALL NOT contain whitespace, terms or comments.
</p>

<a name="props"></a>
<h3>SNOMED CT Properties</h3>
<p>
In addition to the <a href="terminology-service.html#standard-props">standard properties</a>, the following properties are defined for SNOMED CT:
</p>
<table class="grid">
<tr><td nowrap><strong>Property Name</strong></td><td nowrap><strong>Data Type</strong></td><td><strong>Comments</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>effectiveTime</td><td>dateTime</td><td>This is the effectiveTime value from the RF2 concepts file (from the snapshot).</td></tr>
<tr><td>inactive</td><td>boolean</td><td>Whether the code is active or not (defaults to false). This is derived from the active column in the Concept file of the RF2 Distribution (by inverting the value).</td></tr>
<tr><td>moduleId</td><td>code</td><td>The SNOMED CT concept id of the module that the concept belongs to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>normalForm</td><td>string</td><td>Generated Necessary Normal Form expression for the provided code or expression, with terms.  The normal form expressions are not suitable for use in subsumption testing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>normalFormTerse</td><td>string</td><td>Generated Necessary Normal form expression for the provided code or expression, concept ids only.  The normal form expressions are not suitable for use in subsumption testing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>semanticTag</td><td>code</td><td>The phrase inside the last set of brackets of its Fully Specified Name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>sufficientlyDefined</td><td>boolean</td><td>True if the description logic definition of the concept
  includes sufficient conditions. This is derived from the definitionStatusId
  value in the Concept file of the RF2 distribution (i.e. If 900000000000073002
  |Sufficiently defined concept definition status| then true).</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
SNOMED CT relationships, where the relationship
type is subsumed by 410662002 |Concept model attribute|, also
automatically become properties. Properties that represent SNOMED CT concept
model attributes are referred to using their concept id, rather than their
human readable term.
</p>
<p>
For example, the laterality property is represented using the concept id
'272741003', rather than the term 'laterality':
</p>
<table class="grid">
<tr><td nowrap><strong>Property Name</strong></td><td nowrap><strong>Data Type</strong></td><td><strong>Comments</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>272741003</td><td>code</td><td>
  <p>The value of the laterality attribute in the definition of the given code or expression.  The equivalent URI for the laterality property is <code><a href="http://snomed.info/id/272741003">http://snomed.info/id/272741003</a>.</code></p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that when a <a href="codesystem-operation-lookup.html">$lookup</a> operation is performed on a SNOMED CT concept,
servers SHALL return the URI for the edition and version being used (see above) in the <code>version</code> property.
Other properties are at the discretion of the server and the client.
</p>

<a name="filters"></a>
<h3>SNOMED CT Filters</h3>

<p>
This section documents the property filters that can be used with the SNOMED CT
code system in value set composition statements.  For implementer convenience, some of the property filters are documented in terms
of the <a href="http://snomed.org/ecl">SNOMED CT Expression Constraint Language</a>, but this does not imply that its use is required.

<h3>Implicit Value Sets</h3>

<p>
Implicit value sets are those whose specification can be predicted based on the grammar of the
underlying code system, and the known structure of the URL that identifies them. SNOMED CT
has two common sets of implicit value sets defined: By Subsumption, and By Reference Set.
These implicit value sets do not use complex queries. Implicit value sets can also be defined using an expression constraint.  The implicit value set capability allows a single URL to serve as a value set definition, and can serve as the basis for the <a href="valueset-operation-expand.html">$expand</a> operation and for other value set references.
</p>
<p>
If any value set resources exist with an identifier that conforms to the URL patterns specified below,
the content of the resource must conform to the template provided. Profiles and other value set
references can reference these value sets directly (by reference as a URI, rather than
by a literal value set reference).
</p>
<p>
A SNOMED CT implicit value set URL has two parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The base URL is either <a href="http://snomed.info/sct">http://snomed.info/sct</a>, or the URI for the edition version, in the format specified by SNOMED International in the <a href="http://snomed.org/uristandard">SNOMED CT URI Specification</a></li>
  <li>A query portion that specifies the scope of the content</li>
</ul>
<p>
The URL <a href="http://snomed.info/sct">http://snomed.info/sct</a> should be understood to mean an unspecified edition/version. This defines an incomplete value set whose
actual membership will depend on the edition used when it is expanded. If no version or edition is specified, the terminology
service SHALL use the latest version available for its default edition (or the International Edition, if no other edition is the default).
</p>
<p>
For the second part of the URL (the query part), the 5 possible values are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>?fhir_vs - all concept ids in the edition/version. If the base URI is <a href="http://snomed.info/sct">http://snomed.info/sct</a>, this means all possible SNOMED CT concepts</li>
  <li>?fhir_vs=isa/[sctid] - all concept ids that are subsumed by the specified concept.</li>
  <li>?fhir_vs=refset - all concept ids that correspond to reference sets that are explicitly defined in the specified SNOMED CT edition</li>
  <li>?fhir_vs=refset/[sctid] - all concept ids in the specified reference set</li>
  <li>?fhir_vs=ecl/[ecl] - all concept ids that match the supplied (URI-encoded) expression constraint</li>
</ul>

<p>
A value set with a URL that follows the pattern "[edition/version]?fhir_vs=isa/[sctid]" follows this template:

<h3>Implicit Concept Maps</h3>

<p>
Implicit concept maps are those whose specification can be predicted based on the grammar and/or content of the
underlying code system, and the known structure of the URL that identifies them. This allows a single URL to serve
as a concept map definition that defines a mapping between two sets of concepts, and which can serve as the basis for the
<a href="conceptmap-operation-translate.html">$translate</a> operation. SNOMED CT has two common sets of implicit
concept maps defined:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Association Reference Sets</li>
 <li>Simple Map Reference Sets</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/5.2.5+Association+Reference+Set">Association Reference Sets</a>
are part of the core SNOMED CT distribution. The following standard Association Reference sets can be used for implicit
concept maps:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td><b>Name</b></td><td><b>Concept Id</b></td><td><b>Relationship</b></td></tr>
 <tr><td>POSSIBLY EQUIVALENT TO</td><td>900000000000523009</td><td>inexact</td></tr>
 <tr><td>REPLACED BY</td><td>900000000000526001</td><td>equivalent</td></tr>
 <tr><td>SAME AS</td><td>900000000000527005</td><td>equal</td></tr>
 <tr><td>ALTERNATIVE</td><td>900000000000530003</td><td>inexact</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<p>
<a href="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/5.2.5+Association+Reference+Set">Simple Map Reference Sets</a>
(reference sets which are descendants of 900000000000496009 "Simple map") also define an implicit concept map.
</p>
If any ConceptMap resources exist with an identifier that conforms to the URL pattern
specified below, the content of the resource must conform to the template provided.
Canonical references to ConceptMap resource instances are made using their URI.
</p>
<p>
A SNOMED CT implicit concept map URL has two parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The base URL is either <a href="http://snomed.info/sct">http://snomed.info/sct</a>, or the URI for the edition version, in the format specified by SNOMED International in the <a href="http://snomed.org/uristandard">SNOMED CT URI Specification</a></li>
  <li>A query portion that specifies the scope of the content</li>
</ul>
<p>
The URL <a href="http://snomed.info/sct">http://snomed.info/sct</a> should be understood to mean an unspecified edition/version. This defines an incomplete concept map whose actual membership will depend on the edition being used. If no version or edition is specified, the terminology service SHALL use the latest version available for its default edition (or the International Edition, if no other edition is the default).
</p>
<p>
For the second part of the URL (the query part), there is only one possible value:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>?fhir_cm=[sctid] - where [sctid] is a value from the table above</li>
</ul>

<p>
A concept map with a URL that follows the pattern "[edition/version]?fhir_cm=[sctid]" follows this template, where [name], [sctid] and [relationship] are taken from the table above:
</p>
<pre class="xml" id="e4" fragment="ConceptMap">
&lt;ConceptMap xmlns=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir&quot;&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;
    &lt;status value=&quot;generated&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
     [Some HTML that describes this concept map]
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;url value=&quot;[edition/version]?fhir_cm=[sctid]&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;version value=&quot;[edition/version]&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;name value=&quot;SNOMED CT [name] Concept Map&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;description value=&quot;The concept map implicitly defined by the [name] Association Reference Set&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;status value=&quot;active&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;sourceUri value=&quot;[edition/version]?fhir_vs&quot;/&gt;
