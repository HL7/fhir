  <h2>Extensions</h2>
  <p>
    Not all resources that follow the 'Shareable' pattern will necessarily include all of the above elements.  A set of standard extensions have been defined
    for use with resources where an element might be "applicable" but is not commonly supported.  A list of these can be found on the
    <a href="artifact-extensions.html">Artifact Extensions</a> page.
