This tutorial introduces the FHIR <a href="mapping-language.html">mapping language</a>.
</p>
<h3>Step #1: Simplest possible transform</h3>
<p>
To start with, we're going to consider a very simple case: mapping between two structures
that have the same definition, a single element with the same name and the same primitive type:
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td><b>Source Structure</b></td><td><b>Target Structure</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><pre>
    TLeft
      a : string [0..1]
  </pre></td><td><pre>
    TRight
      a : string [0..1]
  </pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">The left instance is transformed to the right instance by copying a to a</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<i>Note that for clarity in this tutorial, all the types are prefixed with T.</i>
</p>

<p>
The first task to do is to set up the mapping context. For this tutorial, this means
declaring the source and target models, and specifying that an application invokes
this with a copy of the left (source) instance, and also an empty copy of the right
(target) instance: 
</p>
<pre>
map "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureMap/tutorial" = tutorial

uses "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/tutorial-left" as source
uses "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/tutorial-right" as target

input "source" : TLeft as source
input "target" : TRight as target

-- tutorial mappings ----------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>
Note that the way this is set up is a choice: we choose to provide the 
underlying type definitions on which both source and target models are based,
and we choose to specify that the invoking application most provide both
the source and the target instance trees. Other options are possible; these 
are discussed further below. The rest of the tutorial examples use the same set
up.
</p>
<p>
The line starting with -- tutorial... sets up a section. Each mapping source
can contain multiple sections each with different names. These are purely for
the benefit of human editors, to help organise the source, and have no operational meaning.
</p>
<p>
Having set up the context, we now need to define the relationship between
the source and target structures:
</p>
<pre>
"rule_a" : for source.a as a make target.a = copy(a)
</pre>
<p>
This simple statement says that:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>for every source (there'll only be one)</li>
 <li>for any element 'a' in the source</li>
 <li>if there isn't any element 'a', then don't do anything</li>
 <li>if there is one, call it variable 'a'</li>
 <li>the value of property 'a' of the target will be a copy of variable a - that is, source.a</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that the types don't feature in the mapping.
</p>

<h3>Step #2: Fields with different names</h3>
<p>
Now consider the case where the elements have different names:
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td><b>Source Structure</b></td><td><b>Target Structure</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><pre>
    TLeft
      a1 : string [0..1]
  </pre></td><td><pre>
    TRight
      a2 : string [0..1]
  </pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">The left instance is transformed to the right instance by copying a1 to a2</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This relationship is a simple variation of the last:
</p>
<pre>
"rule_a1" : for source.a1 as b make target.a2 = copy(b)
</pre>
<p>
Note that the choice of variable name is purely arbitrary. It does not need to be the same as the element name.
</p>

<h3>Step #3: Length restriction</h3>
<p>
Still sticking with very simple mappings, let's consider the case where there is a length restriction on the target model that is shorter than the one on the source 
model - in this case, 20 characters.
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td><b>Source Structure</b></td><td><b>Target Structure</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><pre>
    TLeft
      a2 : string [0..1]
  </pre></td><td><pre>
    TRight
      a2 : string [0..1] {maxlength = 20}
  </pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">The left instance is transformed to the right instance by copying a2 to a2, but target.a2 can only be 20 characters long</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
There are 3 different ways to express this mapping, depending on what should happen when the length of source.a is > 20 characters:
</p>
<pre>
"rule_a20a" : for source.a2 as a make target.a2 = truncate(a, 20) // just cut it off at 20 characters
"rule_a20b" : for source.a2 as a where a1.length &lt;= 20 make target.a2 = copy(a) // ignore it
"rule_a20c" : for source.a2 as a check a2.length &lt;= 20 make target.a2 = copy(a) // error if it's longer than 20 characters
</pre>
<p>
Note that it is implicit here that the transformation engine is not required to expected to validate the 
output against that underlying structure definitions that may apply to it. An application may - and usually 
should - validate the outputs after the transforms, but the transform engine itself should not assume that it's the 
final step in the process and automatically validate the output. 
</p>

<h3>Step #4: Type Conversion</h3>
<p>
Now for the case where there is a simple type conversion between left and right, in this case from a string to an integer.
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td><b>Source Structure</b></td><td><b>Target Structure</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><pre>
    TLeft
      a21 : string [0..1]
  </pre></td><td><pre>
    TRight
      a21 : integer [0..1] 
  </pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">The left instance is transformed to the right instance by copying a21 to a21, but a21 is converted to an integer</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
There are 3 different ways to express this mapping, depending on what should happen when a is not an integer:
</p>
<pre>
"rule_a21a" : for source.a21 as a make target.a21 = cast(a, "integer") // error if it's not an integer
"rule_a21b" : for source.a21 as a where a1.isInteger make target.a2 = cast(a, "integer") // ignore it
"rule_a21c" : for source.a21 as a where not at1.isInteger make target.a21 = copy(0) // just assign it 0
</pre>

<h3>Step #5: Managing lists, part 1</h3>
<p>
Back to the simple case where source.a22 is copied to target.a22, but in this case, a22 can repeat (in both source and target):
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td><b>Source Structure</b></td><td><b>Target Structure</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><pre>
    TLeft
      a22 : string [0..*]
  </pre></td><td><pre>
    TRight
      a22 : integer [0..*] 
  </pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">The left instance is transformed to the right instance by copying a22 to a22, once for each copy of a22</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The transform rule simply asserts that a22 maps to a22. The engine will apply the rule once for each instance of a22:
</p>
<pre>
"rule_a22" : for source.a22 as a make target.a22 = copy(a) 
</pre>

<h3>Step #6: Managing lists, part 2</h3>
<p>
A more difficult case is where the source allows multiple repeats, but the target doesn't:
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td><b>Source Structure</b></td><td><b>Target Structure</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><pre>
    TLeft
      a23 : string [0..*]
  </pre></td><td><pre>
    TRight
      a23 : integer [0..1] 
  </pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">The left instance is transformed to the right instance by copying a23 to a23, but there can only be one copy of a23</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Again, there are multiple different ways to write this, depending on out desired outcome if there is more than one copy of a23:
</p>
<pre>
rule_a23a : for source.a23 as a make target.a23 = copy(a) { only_one } // transform engine creates an error 
rule_a23b : for source.a23 as a make target.a23 = copy(a)  // leave error to lower layer; less informative

rule_a23c_1 : for source.a23 as a then rule_a23c_2
rule_a23c_2 : for a where @context = source.a23.first make target.a23 = copy(a) // only use the first item in the list
</pre>
<p>
The last rule is the first example of stringing rules together. In this case, rule_a23c_1 exists to define a variable for 
the list so that the where condition can compare the items in the list against a criteria expressed against abother variable. 
The ability to compare conditions amongst variables like this in the where clause is a powerful technique that will explored 
further below.
</p>

<h3>Step #7: Simple Nesting</h3>
<p>
Most transformations involve nested content. Let's start with a simple case, where element aa contains ab: 
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td><b>Source Structure</b></td><td><b>Target Structure</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><pre>
    TLeft
      aa : [0..*]
        ab : string [1..1]
  </pre></td><td><pre>
    TRight
      aa : [0..*]
        ab : string [1..1]
  </pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">The left instance is transformed to the right instance by copying aa to aa, and within aa, ab to ab</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that there is no specified type for the element aa. Some structure definitions (FHIR resources) do 
leave these elements as anonymously typed, while others explicitly type them. However since the mapping
does not refer to the type, it's literal type is not important.
</p>
<pre>
rule_aa : for source.aa as s_aa make target.aa as t_aa then by variables // make aa exist
rule_ab : for s_aa.ab as ab make t_aa.a2 = copy(ab) // copy ab inside aa
</pre>
<p>
This situation is handled by a pair of rules: the first rule establishes that relationship
between source.aa and target.aa, and assigns 2 variable names to them. Then, the rule says to 
check other rules for mappings involving s_aa and t_aa, and apply any other rules that match.
In this case, rule_ab matches, and so for every source.aa, source.ab will be copied to target.aa.
</p>
<p>
Note that the source and target variables never overlap, so both of the variables could have been 
named 'aa' with no ambiguity, but overloading the names like this is avoided in this tutorial due
to the potential for reader confusion.
</p>
<p>
In this case, the first rule specified for the any additional rules involving the variables 
defined by applying the rule. This is a very flexible way to set up the mapping arrangements,
but requires discipline in the way that variables are named so as not to get the rules crossed.
</p>

<h3>Step #8: Translation</h3>
<p>
A common translation pattern is to perform a translation e.g. from one set of codes to another
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td><b>Source Structure</b></td><td><b>Target Structure</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><pre>
    TLeft
      d : code [0..1]
  </pre></td><td><pre>
    TRight
      d : [0..1]
  </pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">The left instance is transformed to the right instance by translating source.d from one set of codes to another</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The key to this transformation is the <a href="conceptmap.html">ConceptMap</a> resource, which 
actually specifies the mapping from one set of codes to the other:
</p>
<pre>
rule_d : for source.d as d make target.d = translate(d, 'uri-of-concept-map', 'code')
</pre>
<p>
This asks the mapping engine to use the <a href="conceptmap-operations.html#translate">$translate</a>
operation on the terminology server to translate the code, and then to put the code value of the 
return translation in target.d.
</p>

<h3>Step #9: Co-dependency in translation</h3>
<p>
Another common translation is where the target mapping for one element depends on the 
value of another element. 
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td><b>Source Structure</b></td><td><b>Target Structure</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><pre>
    TLeft
      i : string [0..1]
      l : integer [1..1]
  </pre></td><td><pre>
    TRight
      j : [0..1]
      k : [0..1]
  </pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">How the left instance is transformed to the right instance depends on the value of l: if l &lt; 2, then i maps to j, else it maps to k</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This is managed using conditions on the mapping statements:
</p>
<pre>
rule_i1 : for source.i as i where l &lt; 2 make target.j = copy(i)
rule_i2 : for source.i as i where l >= 2 make target.j = copy(i)
</pre>

<h3>Step #9: Co-dependency in translation</h3>
<p>
Another common translation is where the target mapping for one element depends on the 
value of another element. 
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td><b>Source Structure</b></td><td><b>Target Structure</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><pre>
    TLeft
      i : string [0..1]
      l : integer [1..1]
  </pre></td><td><pre>
    TRight
      j : [0..1]
      k : [0..1]
  </pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">How the left instance is transformed to the right instance depends on the value of l: if l &lt; 2, then i maps to j, else it maps to k</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This is managed using conditions on the mapping statements:
</p>
<pre>
rule_i1 : for source.i as i where l &lt; 2 make target.j = copy(i)
rule_i2 : for source.i as i where l >= 2 make target.j = copy(i)
</pre>
<p>
Other kind of conditional tests can include value set membership - and by extension to that, use of subsumption testing. 
</p>

<h3>Step #10: Reworking Structure #1</h3>
<p>
It's now time to start maving away from relatively simple cases to some of the harder ones to 
manage mappings for. The first mixes list management, and converting from a specific structure 
to a general structure:
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td><b>Source Structure</b></td><td><b>Target Structure</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><pre>
    TLeft
      e : string [0..*]
      f : string [1..1]
  </pre></td><td><pre>
    TRight
      e : [0..*]
        f : string [1..1]
        g : code [1..1]
  </pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">The left instance is transformed to the right instance by adding one instance of target.e for each source.e, where the value goes into target.e.f, and 
    the value of target.e.g is 'g1'. source.f is also transformed into the same structure, but the value of target.e.g is 'g2'. As an added complication, the value for 
    source.f must come first</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This leads to some more complex mapping statements:
</p>
<pre>
ef_a1: for source.e as s_e make target.e as t_e then ef_a2
ef_a2: for s_e make t_e.f = copy(s_e), t_e.g = copy("g1")

ef_b1: for source.f as s_f make target.e as t_e then ef_b2 { first }
ef_b2: for s_f make t_e.f = copy(s_f), t_e.g = copy("g2")
</pre>

<h3>Step #10: Reworking Structure #2</h3>
<p>
The second example for reworking structure moves cardinality around the heirarchy.
in this case, the source has an optional structure that contains a repeating structure,
while the target puts the cardinality at the next level up:
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td><b>Source Structure</b></td><td><b>Target Structure</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><pre>
    TLeft
      az1 :[0..1]
        az2 : string [1..1]
        az3 : string [0..*]
  </pre></td><td><pre>
    TRight
      az1 :[0..*]
        az2 : string [1..1]
        az3 : string [0..1]   
  </pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">The left instance is transformed to the right instance creating on target.az1 for every source.az1.az3, and then populating 
  each az1 with the matching value of az3, and copying the value of az2 to each instance</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The key to setting this mapping up is to create a variable context for source.az1, and then carry it down, performing the actual mappings at the next level down:
</p>
<pre>
aza : for src.az1 as s_az1 then azb // setting up a variable for the parent
azb : for s_az1.az3 as s_az3 make target.az1 as t_az1 then az2, az3   // one target.az1 for each az3
az2 : for s_az1.az2 as az2 make t_az1.az2 = copy(az2)  // value for az2. Note that this refers to a previous context in the source
az3 : for s_az3 make tgt_az1.az3 = copy(src_az3)       // value for az3      
</pre>

<h3>Step #11: Multiple structures #1</h3>
<p>
Simple mappings, such as we've dealt with so far, where the source and target 
structure both have the same scope, and there is only one of each, are all well
and good, but there are many mappings where this is not the case. There is a set of 
complications when dealing with multiple instances:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>If there are multiple source inputs, how does the application know what they are? Sometimes, they are just independent inputs, but more often, the 
    inputs are dependent on references in the source input, and therefore which source inputs are required depends on the mapping rules</li>
 <li>If there are multiple output instances, how are they identified as they are created, and how do the target models reference each other?
   Mostly, the answer is that it depends on the context; the actual identification details are not part of the mapping</li>
 <li>It may even be the case that the kind of output structure to produce depends on the mapping rules, so the application can't create the target
 structure before invoking the map</li>
</ul>
<p>
For our first example, we're going to look at creating multiple output structures from a single input structure.
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td><b>Source Structure</b></td><td><b>Target Structure</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><pre>
    TLeft
      f1 : String [0..*];
  </pre></td><td><pre>
    TRight
      ptr : Resource(TRight2) [0..*]
  
    TRight2
      f1 : String [1..1];
  </pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">The left instance is transformed to the right instance creating a copy of TRight2 for each f1 in the source, and 
  then putting the value of source.f1 in TRight2.f1</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The key to setting this mapping up is to create a variable context for source.az1, and then carry it down, performing the actual mappings at the next level down:
</p>
<pre>
f1 : for source.f1 as s_f1 make null as rr = create("TRight2"), target.ptr = reference(rr) then f1a.
f1a: for s_f1 make rr.f2 = copy(srcff)
</pre>
<p>
This mapping statement makes use a special known value "null" for the target context to indicate that the created element/object of type "TRight2" 
doesn't get added to any existing target context. Instead, it will only be available as a context in which to perform further mappings - as rule f1a
does.
</p>
<p>
The mapping engine passes the create request through to the host application, which is using the mapping. It must create a valid instance
of TRight, and identify it as appropriate for the technical context in which the mapping is being used. The reference transform is 
also passed back to the host application for it to determine how to represent the reference - but this is usally some kind of URL.
</p>


<h3>Step #12: Multiple structures #2</h3>
<p>
For our second example, we're going to look at the reverse: where  multiple input structures create a single input structure.
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td><b>Source Structure</b></td><td><b>Target Structure</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><pre>
    TLeft
      ptr : Resource(TLeft2) [0..*]
  
    TLeft2
      f2 : String [0..*];
  </pre></td><td><pre>
    TRight
      f2 : String [1..*];
  </pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">The left instance is transformed to the right instance finding each ptr reference, getting
   it's value foe f1, and adding this in target.f2</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The first task of the map is to ask the application host to find the structure 
identified by source.ptr, and create a variable for it
