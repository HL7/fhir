<h3>Biologically Derived Product</h3>
A biologically derived product may be the biological entity that is the source of the Nutrition Product, e.g., pooled human milk, that needs to be traced.  The NutritionProduct represents the dietary administration that, while still maintaining the original source of the NutritionProduct.
</p>
<p>	
<h3>Medication</h3>
Medication covers products such as supplements (e.g., vitamins, minerals, and herbals) or parenteral nutrition (e.g., TPN).
</p>

<p>
<h3>Biologically Derived Product</h3>
If the product is for dietary administration it is represented as a NutritionProduct. If the product is for transplant, infusion, or injection it is represented as a BiologicallyDerivedProduct. We note that this is remains a grey area, particularly around certain uses of donated human milk, and additional use cases may need to be clarified to determine the appropriate representation.  Local implementation guidance may provide further direction.
</p>

<p>
<h3>NutritionIntake</h3>
NutritionIntake should be used to record the Oral intake of food (i.e., solid and/or liquid), oral nutritional supplements, enteral nutrition, and infant formula.
