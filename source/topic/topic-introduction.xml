<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>

Major challenges for R4 Subscriptions:
</p><p>Clients</p>
<ul>
<li>
need to listen for specific changes (i.e., events)
</li>
<li>
 a way to listen for deletes, and resources "falling out" of a set
</li>
<li>
need a way to listen to all changes at one [endpoint], not [endpoint]/[sub]/[path]
</li></ul>

<p>Servers</p>
<ul>
<li>need to limit number + complexity of subscribable Topics
</li>
<li>
should be able to handle large numbers of Subscriptions on a given Topic
</li></ul>
