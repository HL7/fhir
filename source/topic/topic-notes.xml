  <h2>
    Defining Topics

	<a name="deriving" />
	<h2>
		Deriving from existing Topics
	</h2>
  <p>Implementers are encouraged to add additional filters, but cannot remove existing ones nor change the 'concept' of a Topic during derivation.  For example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Deriving a new Topic with the same concept but a different computable definition is OK.</li>
		<li>Deriving a new Topic to expose additional canFilterBy parameters is OK.</li>
		<li>Deriving a new Topic to remove an existing canFilterBy parameter is NOT ok.</li>
		<li>Deriving a new Topic based on a different resource than its parent is NOT ok (e.g., start/end of medication derived from encounter).</li>
	</ul>
