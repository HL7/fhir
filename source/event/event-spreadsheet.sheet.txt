  Definition = Codes identifying the stage lifecycle stage of a event

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = EventCode
  Binding = unbound

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = EventReason
  Binding = unbound
  Definition = Codes identifying why this event was necessary.  These may be clinical reasons (e.g. diagnoses, symptoms) and/or administrative reasons.

  Definition = If true, indicates that the described event (combination of code, timing, performer, etc.) did not actually occur.
  Requirements = Creating a {{title}} where notDone is true is intended for situations where there\'s a need for a specific statement in the record about something not being done.  If the need is merely to indicate that a request wasn\'t fulfilled, that should be handled using Task.
  Comments = The more attributes are populated, the more constrained the negated statement is.  For example if timeframe and performer are specified, that means the event wasn\'t done by that performer in that time-period, but could well have been done by someone else or by that performer in a different time period.
