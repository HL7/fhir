<h2>Transforms between R4 and R5</h2>

<p>
In addition to a <a href="diff.html">list of all differences between R4 and R5</a>,
this specification also provides transforms between R4 and R5 for most resources
that were in R4 or R4B. These transforms are expressed using the 
<a href="mapping-language.html">FHIR Mapping Language</a>, and both serve as
formal documentation of the relationship between the resource structures in R4 and R5, 
and can also be used to convert between the formats automatically. 
</p>
<p style="background: gold">The maps provided in the specification are not authoritative; 
they are provided to help implementers  who need to convert between the R5 and R4 or R4B and 
R4 format, but additional revision may be required in an implementation specific context.
</p>
