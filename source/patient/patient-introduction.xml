The data in a Patient Resource is generally kept in the interest of an organization, which also assigns a patient number and is responsible for the upkeep of the patient's record. 
A person or animal receiving care at multiple organizations will therefore have its information present in multiple Patient Resources.

The data in the Resource covers the "who" information about the patient: Its attributes are focused on the demographic information necessary to support the administrative, 
financial and logistic procedures and does not contain medical or care-related information.
