<h2>Scope and Usage that I have modified</h2>
<p>
This Resource covers data about patients and animals involved in a wide range of health-related activities, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Curative activities</li>
<li>Psychiatric care</li>
<li>Social services</li>
<li>Pregnancy care</li>
<li>Nursing and assisted living</li>
<li>Dietary services</li>
<li>Tracking of personal health and exercise data</li>
</ul>
<p>
The data in the Resource covers the "who" information about the patient: its attributes are focused on the demographic
information necessary to support the administrative, financial and logistic procedures. A Patient record is generally 
created and maintained by each organization providing care for a patient. A patient or animal receiving care at multiple
organizations may therefore have its information present in multiple Patient Resources.
</p>
<p>
Not all concepts are included within the base resource (such as race, ethnicity, organ donor status, nationalilty, etc.), 
but may be found in <a href="patient-profiles.html">profiles</a> defined for specific jurisdictions (e.g., US Meaningful Use Program) or <a href="patient-extensions.html">standard extensions</a>.<br/>
Such fields vary widely between jurisdictions and often have different names and valuesets for the similar concepts,
but they are not similar enough to be able to map and exchange
