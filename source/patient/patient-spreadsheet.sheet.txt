  Requirements = Needed for identification of the individual, in combination with (at least) name and birth date. Gender of individual drives many clinical processes.
  Comments = The gender may not match the biological sex as determined by genetics, or the individual\'s preferred identification. Note that for both humans and particularly animals, there are other legitimate possibilities than M and F, though the vast majority of systems and contexts only support M and F.  Systems providing decision support or enforcing business rules should ideally do this on the basis of Observations dealing with the specific gender aspect of interest (anatomical, chromosonal, social, etc.)  However, because these observations are infrequently recorded, defaulting to the administrative gender is common practice.  Where such defaulting occurs, rule enforcement should allow for the variation between administrative and biological, chromosonal and other gender aspects.  For example, an alert about a hysterectomy on a male should be handled as a warning or overrideable error, not a \"hard\" error.

Systems SHALL either handle patient details appropriately (e.g. inform users patient is not human) or reject declared animal records.   The absense of the animal element does not imply that the patient is a human. If a system requires such a positive assertion that the patient is human, an extension will be required.

If you need to convey proficiency for multiple modes then you need multiple Patient.Communication associations.

  Name = match
  Use = Resource
  Documentation = A Master Patient Index ([MPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_master_patient_index) ) is a service used to manage patient identification in a context where multiple patient databases exist. Healthcare applications and middleware use the MPI to match patients between the databases, and as new patient details are encountered. MPIs are highly specialized applications, often tailored extensively to the institution\'s particular mix of patients. MPIs can also be run on a regional and national basis.\n\nTo ask an MPI to match a patient, clients use the \"mpi\" query, which takes either a candidate patient resource, or a set of normal search parameters defined for patient. The data provided is interpreted as an MPI input and  passed to an MPI algorithm of some kind that uses them to determine the most appropriate matches in the patient set. \n\nNote that different MPI matching algorithms have different required inputs. The generic $match operation does not specify any particular algorithm, nor a minimum set of information that must be provided when asking for an MPI match operation to be performed, but may implementations will have a set of minimum information, which may be declared in their definition of the $match operation
  Type = operation
  Example.Request = $match-request.txt
  Example.Response = $match-response.txt
  Title = Find patient matches using MPI based logic
  Footer = The response from an \"mpi\" query is a bundle containing patient records, ordered from most likely to least likely. If there are no patient matches, the MPI SHALL return an empty search set with no error, but may include an operation outcome with further advice regarding patient selection. All patient records SHALL have a search score from 0 to 1, where 1 is the most certain match, along with an extension \"[match-grade](extension-match-grade.html)\" that indicates the MPI\'s position on the match quality.

This may be used by the MPI to restrict the possible matches that are returned, based on the user\'s rights. For example, a staff member covered by policies, etc., may well get a different result than a patient trying to find their own record. Note that this parameter is used where the user would not be expected to log in to the MPI directly; whether this is appropriate or not is a deployment choice.

  Use = Resource | Instance
  Documentation = This operation is used to return all the information related to the patient described in the resource on which this operation is invoked. The response is a bundle of type \"searchset\". At a minimum, the patient resource itself is returned, along with any other resources that the server has that are related to the patient, and that are available for the given user. The server also returns whatever resources are needed to support the records - e.g. linked practitioners, medications, locations, organizations etc. The principle intended use for this operation is to provide a patient with access to their entire record (e.g. \"Blue Button\").  The server SHOULD return at least all resources that it has that are in the patient compartment for the identified patient, and any resource referenced from those, including binaries and attachments. In the US Realm, at a mimimum, the resources returned SHALL include all the data covered by the meaningful use common data elements as defined in [DAF](http://hl7.org/fhir/daf). Other applicable implementation guides may make additional rules about how much information that is returned
  Type = operation
  Example.Request = $everything-request.txt
  Example.Response = $everything-response.txt
  Title = Fetch Patient Record
  Footer = The key differences between this operation and simply searching the patient compartment are:  \n\n* unless the client requests otherwise, the server returns the entire result set in a single bundle (rather than using paging) \n* the server is responsible for determining what resources to return as included resources (rather than the client specifying which ones). This frees the client from needing to determine what it could or should ask for\n\nIt is assumed that the server has identified and secured the context appropriately, and can either associate the authorization context with a single patient, or determine whether the context has the rights to the nominated patient, if there is one. If there is no nominated patient (e.g. the operation is invoked at the system level) and the context is not associated with a single patient record, then the server should return an error. Specifying the relationship between the context, a user and patient records is outside the scope of this specification.
