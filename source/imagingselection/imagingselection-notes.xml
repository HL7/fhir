<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
  <h4>Imaging Selection Subsets</h4>
  <p>Some DICOM SOP Instances contain multiple sub-resources, such as frames, segments, etc.</p>
  <p>An Imaging Selection resource may specify the subset of these that are included in the selection using the <code>instance.subset</code> element.</p>
  <p>The defined types of subsets are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Frames selected from a multiframe SOP Instance</li>
    <li>Content Item Observation UIDs selected from a DICOM SR or other structured document SOP Instance</li>
    <li>Segments selected from a segmentation SOP Instance</li>
    <li>Regions of interest selected from a radiotherapy structure set SOP Instance</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The type of subset is determined by the SOP Class of the parent instance.</p>
  <p>Subsets can only reference sub-resources that are already defined within the selected DICOM SOP Instance.</p>
