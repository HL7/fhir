    <h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
    <p>This resource is an <a href="workflow.html#event">
      <em>event resource</em>
    </a> from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a>.</p>
    <p>A selection of DICOM SOP instances and/or frames within a single Study and Series which might or might not include additional specifics such as region or other DICOM UIDs, for example, ObservationUID, TrackingUID or SegmentationUID, allowing linkage to an <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> or transferring this information along with the <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a>.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> DICOM SOP Instances can include images, videos, waveforms or documents.</p>
    <p>Uses for ImagingSelection resources include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Referencing a specific image, frame or region in an <a href="observation.html">Observation</a></li>
      <li>Referencing the set of images, frames or segments constituting a volume in an <a href="observation.html">Observation</a></li>
      <li>Referencing the set of image coordinates that relate to a measurement in an <a href="observation.html">Observation</a></li>
      <li>Linking a node in a DICOM Structured Report SOP Instance to an <a href="observation.html">Observation</a></li>
      <li>Specifying key images or presentation states in an <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a></li>
      <li>Providing additional context to imaging applications in a context-sharing environment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All DICOM SOP Instances referenced shall be part of the same DICOM Series (and therefore also the same DICOM Study).</p>

    <h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
    <p>An <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> might reference an ImagingSelection to specify the set of DICOM images, frames, waveforms or documents used to make the <a href="observation.html">Observation</a>. By contrast, an <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> might be referenced if the <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> does not depend on any specific set of images, frames, waveforms or documents.</p>
    <p>>Additionally, an <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> might reference an ImagingSelection to specify an image region corresponding to the measurement value expressed in the <a href="observation.html">Observation</a>.</p>
    <p>While an ImagingSelection is restricted to a single DICOM Study and Series, a single <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> might reference multiple ImagingSelection resources if it relates to multiple Studies and / or Series â€“ for example, to reference multiple images over different cardiac phases or a PET and a CT image.</p>
    <p>A <a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReport</a> might or might not directly reference an ImagingSelection but might include one or more Observations derived from ImagingSelection resources.</p>
    <p>In contrast with a <a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a>, an ImagingSelection includes the ability to specify a region within an image, an observation node within a DICOM Structured Reporting (SR) and the ability to specify one or more Endpoint resources for retrieval of the referenced images, frames, waveforms or documents. Additionally, <a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a> has limited ability to reference multiple images or frames and can only specify the Study, Series and SOP Instance UIDs implicitly via the URL.</p>
    <p><a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a> might still be appropriate for including a rendered DICOM image in cases where the full image context is not important.</p>
