    <h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
    <p>This resource is an <a href="workflow.html#event">
      <em>event resource</em>
    </a> from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a>.</p>
    <p>A selection of data from an ImagingStudy. The selection MAY be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All DICOM SOP Instances in a single DICOM Series</li>
      <li>A set of DICOM SOP Instances within a single DICOM Series</li>
      <li>A set of frames within one or more DICOM multiframe image SOP Instances</li>
      <li>A set of segments within one or more DICOM segmentation SOP Instances</li>
      <li>A set of content items within one or more DICOM Structured Report SOP Instances</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>May also represent regions within the <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> frame of reference, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A 2D region within one or more DICOM image SOP Instances</li>
      <li>A 3D region within a DICOM Frame of Reference</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Uses for ImagingSelection resources include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identifying a specific set of images or frames as the focus of an <a href="observation.html">Observation</a></li>
      <li>Identifying a spatial region or volume as the focus of an <a href="observation.html">Observation</a></li>
      <li>Identifying the set of image coordinates as the focus of a measurement represented by an <a href="observation.html">Observation</a></li>
      <li>Identifying a node in a DICOM Structured Report SOP Instance from which an <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> is derived</li>
      <li>Identifying images, frames or presentation states selected as part of shared application context in a context-sharing environment</li>
      <li>Identifying a specific set of images, frames or presentation states to be presented</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All DICOM SOP Instances referenced in a single ImagingSelection resource SHALL be part of the same DICOM Series (and therefore also the same DICOM Study). In order to reference SOP Instances in multiple Studies or Series it is necessary to create multiple ImagingSelection resources.</p>

    <h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>

    <p>
    The <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> resource is used to store details of an entire DICOM Study and associated information.
    </p>
    <p>
    The <a href="imagingselection.html">ImagingSelection</a> resource is used to reference to a specific set of specific set of images, frames, waveforms or image regions.
    </p>
    <p>
    An <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> MAY be related to a set of images in several ways.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="observation.html">Observation.partOf</a> MAY reference an <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a></li>
      <li><a href="observation.html">Observation.derivedFrom</a> MAY reference an <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> when it does not relate to a specific set of images, frames, waveforms or image regions</li>
      <li><a href="observation.html">Observation.derivedFrom</a> MAY reference an <a href="imagingselection.html">ImagingSelection</a> when it directly relates to a specific set of images, frames, waveforms or image regions</li>
      <li><a href="observation.html">Observation.focus</a> MAY reference an <a href="imagingselection.html">ImagingSelection</a> when it is a measurement of the set of images, frames, waveforms or image regions described by the <a href="imagingselection.html">ImagingSelection</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>While an ImagingSelection is restricted to a single DICOM Series, a single <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> references multiple ImagingSelection resources if it relates to multiple Studies and / or Series – for example, to reference multiple images over different cardiac phases or a PET and a CT image.</p>
    <p>A <a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReport</a> might directly reference an ImagingSelection that includes one or more Observations derived from ImagingSelection resources.</p>
    <p>In contrast with a <a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a>, an ImagingSelection includes the ability to specify a region within an image, an observation node within a DICOM Structured Reporting (SR) and the ability to specify one or more Endpoint resources for retrieval of the referenced images, frames, waveforms or documents. Additionally, <a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a> has limited ability to reference multiple images or frames and can only specify the Study, Series and SOP Instance UIDs implicitly via the URL.</p>
    <p><a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a> might be appropriate for including a rendered DICOM image in cases where the full image context is not important.</p>
