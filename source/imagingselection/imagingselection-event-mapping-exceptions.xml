As well, some categories might not be mutually exclusive, so systems should prepare for multiple declared categories - even within a single category 'axis'.&#10;In general, there should not be a 'strong' binding ('required' or 'extensible') on the category element overall.  Instead, the element can be sliced and bindings can be asserted that apply to particular repetitions."/>
