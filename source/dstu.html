<h2>DSTU Considerations</h2>

<p>
<b>Attention Implementers, Regulators, standards development organizations and other users (and potential users) of this specification</b>
</p>
<p>
FHIR is being published as a Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU).  The DSTU label has been used with prior HL7 specifications with different intentions.
As well, those making use of FHIR may not be familiar with HL7 standards processes.  For this reason, the FHIR Governance is providing the following 
guidance for the users of the FHIR specification to make clear our intentions.
</p>
<p>
The FHIR specification is "draft".  It has been subject to significant review through ballot and other HL7 processes and many aspects of it have been 
implemented and subjected to interoperability testing through Connectathons and early adoption.  However, the degree of testing has varied.  Some resources 
have been well tested in a variety of environments, others have received relatively little real-world exercise.  In general, the infrastructure should be 
considered to be more stable than the resources themselves.  In some cases, there are known issues such as the inelegance of representing complex observations 
such as "blood pressure" or a document that consists primarily of unencoded data.  Guidance from early implementation will help address these areas.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of the degree of prior implementation, all aspects of the FHIR specification are potentially subject to change.  These changes may be minor 
(clarifications of definitions, etc.) or major (refactoring of resources, changes to serialization rules, eliminating or adding data types, etc.)  There is no 
commitment to backward or forward compatibility during the DSTU process.  Changes will not be made without cause, however the interests of long-term 
implementability will generally trump the impact on early adopters when determining what changes should be made.
</p>
<p>
This specification has been promoted to DSTU because it is felt that the specification, as is, is implementable and that more value can be gleaned from 
implementer experience than from subsequent review as part of the ballot process.  Implementers who are willing to accept the risk of change (perhaps 
for the benefit of early implementation experience, first mover advantage and the ability to leverage FHIR's intrinsic benefits) are encouraged to implement 
FHIR in real-world systems.  However, those implementers should be aware that local adaptations may be necessary to meet real-world requirements.  Furthermore, 
such implementers should architect their solutions to be tolerant of changes to the specification and, where necessary, to manage interoperability with systems 
that may be using different versions of the specification or different local adaptations.
</p>
<p>
It is the FHIR Management Group's expectation that at least two DSTU releases (roughly a year apart) will be published prior to balloting the specification as a 
Normative specification.  Once the specification becomes Normative, all stated commitments to backwards compatibility will come into play.  The normative 
specification will include all infrastructure components of FHIR as well as those resources that have been implemented in a sufficient number of diverse 
environments.  Some resources may be left as "informative" within the normative release until such time as sufficient implementation experience has been gained.  
Backwards compatibility rules will not be binding on these informative resources.
</p>
<p>
During the DSTU period, requests for change may be submitted using the HL7 gForge tracker which can be found here: TODO.  Where possible, updates to the 
"development" version of the specification will be made in a timely fashion (ideally within 2 weeks or less).  A list of these proposed changes will be published 
as a continuously updated supplement to the official DSTU publication.  Implementers should be aware that the changes are not considered "official" until such 
time as they are balloted and approved as part of a subsequent DSTU or Normative publication.  Change requests might be fixes to allow implementation, 
clarifications or enhancements.  In addition, HL7 will be developing and introducing additional resources and profiles as part of the FHIR specification.
</p>
<p>
SDOs and regulatory bodies that are interested in making use of the FHIR specification should feel free to do so, but should consider and plan for the possibility 
that the specification will evolve and change prior to becoming normative.
