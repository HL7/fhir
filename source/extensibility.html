</p>
<p>
This exchange specification is based on generally agreed common
requirements across healthcare - covering many jurisdictions, domains, and
different functional approaches. As such, it is common for
specific implementations to have valid requirements that will not
be directly included in this specification. Incorporating all of these requirements
would make this specification very cumbersome and difficult to
implement. Instead, this specification expects that these additional
distinct requirements will be implemented as extensions.
</p>
<p>
As such, extensibility is a fundamental part of the design of this
specification. Every element in a resource may have extension child elements 
to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition 
of the resource. Conformant applications are not allowed to reject resources 
because they contain extensions, though they may need to reject resources 
because of the specific contents of the extensions.
</p>
<p>
Note that, unlike in many other specifications, there can be no stigma
associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or
standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the
extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core
simplicity for everyone.
</p>
<p>
In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a
strict governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though
any implementer is allowed to define and use extensions, there is a set of requirements
that must be met as part of theie use and definition.
</p>
<a name="Extension"></a>
<h2>Extension Element</h2>
<p>
Every element in a resource includes an optional "extension" child element that may 
be present any number of times. The extension elements appears as 
the first set of children, prior to any other defined child elements. 
This is the content model of the extension as it appears in each resource:
</p>
<%dt Extension%>
<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The <i>url</i> is a mandatory field, and identifies an extension definition in a <a href="profile.html">resource profile</a> that defines the content and meaning of the extension.</li>
 <li>The actual content of the extension consists of either a single value in the <i>value[x]</i> element, or it can can contain additional extensions, each with their own defining url and content</li>
 <li>The <i>url</i> element cannot have extensions themselves</li>
 <li>An extension SHALL have either a value (i.e. a value[x] element) or child extensions. The value[x] element SHALL have content, and/or an id attribute that is the target of a reference from the Narrative</li>
 <li>When an extension is the target of an internal reference, the reference is always to the value of the extension. An extension is only allowed to be the target of a reference when it has no value[x]</li>
 <li>It must be safe for an application processing the content of the resource to ignore an extension. Specifically, this should be understand to mean that the content of the extension does not alter the meaning of the element that contains it. See below for further discussion</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <i>value[x]</i> element has the [x] replaced with the title-cased name of one of the defined types, and the contents as defined for that type. The value type may be one of the following:
</p>
<ul class="dense">
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#integer">integer</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#decimal">decimal</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#dateTime">dateTime</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#date">date</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#instant">instant</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#string">string</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#uri">uri</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#boolean">boolean</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#code">code</a> (only if the extension definition provides a <a href="terminologies.tml#complete">complete</a> binding to a suitable set of codes)</li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#base64Binary">base64Binary</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#Coding">Coding</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#CodeableConcept">CodeableConcept</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#Attachment">Attachment</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#Identifier">Identifier</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#Quantity">Quantity</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#Range">Range</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#Period">Period</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#Ratio">Ratio</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#HumanName">HumanName</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#Address">Address</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#Contact">Contact</a></li>
 <li><a href="datatypes.html#Schedule">Schedule</a></li>
 <li><a href="references.html#ResourceReference">Resource</a> - a reference to another resource</li>
</ul>

<p>
An extension would contain other extensions instead of a value where the original definition of the extension defines 
complex content (i.e. the extension ahs multiple parts, not a simple data type). If the value of the extension itself 
needs extending, those extensions go in the content of the value[x] element.
</p>
<div class="example">
<p>
Here is an example of a name with a simple extension for a tribal name:
</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="HumanName">
&lt;name&gt;
  &lt;extension&gt;
    &lt;url value=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/Profileiso-21090#name-use&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;valueCode value=&quot;I&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/extension&gt;
  &lt;text value=&quot;Chief Red Cloud&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/name&gt;
</pre>
<p>
or in JSON:
</p>
<pre class="json">
"name" : {
  "extension: [
    {
      "url" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/Profileiso-21090#name-use",
      "valueCode" : "I"
     }]
  "text": "Chief Red Cloud"/>
}
</pre>
<p>
The proper use of the URL value is discussed below.
</p>
<p>
Extending a patient with an opt-in status for a clinical trial, with 
3 fields: status, date of recording, and person who recorded:

    &lt;extension&gt;

        &lt;reference value=&quot;Practitioner/example&quot; /&gt;	  	    
      &lt;/valueResource&gt;	  
    &lt;/extension&gt;
    &lt;url value=&quot;http://acme.org/fhir/profiles/@main#trial-status&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/extension&gt;
  &lt;!-- other data for patient --&gt;
&lt;/Patient&gt;
</pre>
<p>
or in JSON:
</p>
<pre class="json">
{
  "resource-type" : "Patient",
  "extension" : [
    {
      "url" : "http://acme.org/fhir/profiles/@main#trial-status",
      "extension" : [
        {
          "url" : "http://acme.org/fhir/profiles/@main#trial-status-code",
          "valueCode" : "unsure"
        }, 
        {
          "url" : "http://acme.org/fhir/profiles/@main#trial-status-date",
          "valueDate" : "2009-03-14"
        },

          }
        }
     ]
   }
  ], 
  ... other data for patient... 
}

<h2>Modifier Extensions</h2>
<p>
There are some cases where the information provided in extensions modifies the meaning 
of the element that contains it. Typically, this means information that qualifies or 
negates the primary meaning of the element that contains it. Some examples:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Adding a certainty extension to an <a href="adversereaction.html">Adverse Reaction</a> that includes a value "highly doubtful"</li>
 <li>Asserting an additional subsumption relationship on a concept in a <a href="valueset.html">value set</a></li>
 <li>An anti-prescription: recording an instruction <b>not</b> to take a medication</li>
 <li>Using the <a href="condition.html">Condition</a> resource to record an assertion that a patient <b>doesn't</b> have a particular diagnosis</li>
 <li>Asserting that a performer was <b>not</b> actually involved in a <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a></li>
 <li>Recording that a <a href="supply.html">Supply</a> was <b>not</b> provided (i.e. refusal to fill)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Implementers are encouraged not to use modifier extensions, and any use should be 
carefully considered against it's possible downstream consequences. However implementers
are often forced into these kind of arrangements by the business arrangements around
the use of resources, so this specification creates a framework for handling these.
</p>
<p>
In these cases an application cannot safely process the resource unless it knows
what the extension means for it's own use of the data. This specification allows for 
such modifier elements to be included at the base of a resource, or in any elements
that do not have a data type (e.g. the elements that correspond to classes in the UML
diagrams), using an element named "modifierExtension", which has same content as the 
<i>extension</i> element documented above. 
</p>
<p>
Implementations processing the data in resources SHALL understand the impact 
of the extension when using the data. If an application processing the content 
of a resource does not recognize a modifierExtension, and the data from the 
element it extends is processed by the application, the application SHALL 
either refuse to process the data, or carry a warning concerning the data 
along with any action or output that results from processing the data to 
inform users that it has not fully understood the source information.
</p>
<p>
Implementations are not required to "support" the extension in any meaningful way - they 
may achieve this understanding by rejecting instances that contain this extension. Alternatively,
implementations may be able to be sure, due to their implementation environment, that such extensions
will never occur. However applications SHOULD always check for extensions irrespective of this.
</p>
<p>
Note that processing the data of a resource typically means
copying or filtering data out of a resource for use in another 
context (display to a human, decision support, exchange in another 
format where not all information is included, or storing it for this kind of use).
Servers and background processes that simply move whole resources around unchanged 
are not "processing the data of the resource", and therefore these applications 
are not required to check for unknown extensions. 
</p>

<h3>Summary: Conformance Rules for Modifier Extensions</h3>
<ul>
 <li>A modifierExtension SHALL only modify the element which it contains, and it's children</li>
 <li>It SHALL always be safe to show the narrative to humans; any modifier extension SHALL be represented in the narrative.</li>
 <li>Applications SHALL always check for modifierExtensions when processing the data from any element that may carry one. If a modifierExtension they do not understand is found, the application SHALL either refuse to process the resource, or provide an appropriate warning to it's users</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
 
<div class="example">
<p>
Example: Because of a lack of clinical consensus, there's no element on <a href="allergyintolerance.html">AllergyIntolerance</a> 
for any expression of certaintly around the expression of the Allergy/Intolerance. Some systems mark their entries 
as "unlikely" or "refuted". Applications are allowed to extend a resource with data like this: 
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;AllergyIntolerance&gt;
  &lt;modifierExtension&gt;
    &lt;url value=&quot;http://example.org/fhir/extensions#certainty&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;valueCoding&gt;
      &lt;system value="http://example.org/codes/certainty"/&gt;
      &lt;code value="2"/&gt;
      &lt;display value="Unlikely"/&gt;
    &lt;/valueCoding&gt;
  &lt;/modifierExtension&gt;
  &lt;!-- .. text etc... --&gt;
&lt;/AllergyIntolerance&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
When an application understands this extension, it means that some developer
has provided appropriate instructions for what to do with the data contained 
in it. Note that there is no obligation that the application do anything at
all with the data - it can ignore it if that is safe in it's own context,
though this would not usually be the case.
</p>
<p>
Whan an application that doesn't understand this extension tries
to process this resource, it is required to either refuse to process 
the resource, or provide an appropriate warning to it's users. Either
of these courses of action is potentially difficult. One option is to 
download the profile that defines the extension (from the given URL), 
find the name of the extension, and then use the name to display
the extension to the user. An error message could look something like
this:
</p>
<img src="modifier-extension-warning.png"/>
<p>
Note that the narrative of the resource SHALL contain this qualifying 
information, so it is safe to show this to the user as an expression 
of the resource's content. A warning dialog box could be extended to
offer the user the choice to see the original narrative. 
</p>
<div class="example">
<p>
Here is an example showing a statement that a particular surgeon did
not perform an operation:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;Procedure xmlns=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir&quot;&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;
    &lt;status value=&quot;generated&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;Routine appendicectomy for Fred Smith performed By Susan Taylor. Note: This operation was not performed by Dr Lakin&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;!-- ...data... --&gt;
  &lt;performer&gt;
    &lt;modifierExtension&gt;
      &lt;url value=&quot;http://example.org/fhir/extensions#didNotPerform&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;valueBoolean value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/modifierExtension&gt;
    &lt;person&gt;
      &lt;reference value=&quot;Practitioner/example&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;display value=&quot;Dr Lakin&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/person&gt;
  &lt;/performer&gt;
  &lt;!-- ...data... --&gt;
&lt;/Procedure&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
In this case, if an application is not reading the performers of the operation at all,
the fact that one of the performers has a modifierExtension is irrelevant, and the 
application is free to ignore it. 
</p>



<h2>Exchanging Extensions</h2>

<p>
Extensions are a way of allowing local requirements to be reflected in a resource using
a common information based approach so that all systems can confidently process them 
using the same tools. However, when it comes to processing the information, applications
will be constrained in their ability to handle resources by the degree to which they 
are informed about them. 
</p>
<p>
While the structured definition of an extension should always be available (see below for 
details), the mere availability of a definition does not automatically mean that applications
know how to handle them correctly - generally, human decisions are required to made around
how the data extensions contain should be handled, along with the implicit obligations 
that around the information. 
</p>
<p>
For this reason, local requirements that manifest as extensions are an obstacle to 
integration. The more the requirements are shared (i.e. regional or national scale),
the less impact they will have. The consistent representation, definition and registration of 
extensions that this specifiation defines cannot resolve that problem - it only provides a framework 
within which such local variations can be handled more easily. 
</p>
<p>
When it comes to deploying applications that support local requirements, situations
will very likely arise where different applications
exchanging information with each other are supporting different sets of extensions.
This specification makes some basic rules that are intended to make management
of these situations easier, but they cannot resolve it.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>When exchanging resources, systems SHOULD retain unknown extensions when they are capable of doing so (just as they SHOULD retain core elements when they are capable of doing so)</li>
 <li>If a system modifies a resource it SHALL remove any extensions that it does not understand from the 
modified element and its descendants, because it cannot know whether the modifications it has made 
might invalidate the value of the unknown extension</li>
 <li>Systems that drop existing elements are considered to be "processing the resource"</li>
 <li>A system SHALL not modify a resource that contains must-understand resource it doesn't understand</li>
 <li>Applications SHOULD ignore extensions that they do not recognize if their "isModifier" element is missing or set to false</li>
 <li>Systems that do not accept unknown extensions SHALL declare so in their Conformance resource instances</li>
</ul>
<p>
The degree to which an system can retain unknown extensions is a function of the type of system
it is: a general purpose FHIR server, or a middleware engine would be expected to retain 
all extensions, while an application that manage patient registration through a user 
interface can only retain extensions to the degree that their information is part of the
set managed by the user. Other applications will fall somewhere between these two extremes.
</p>

<h3>Summary: Handling extensions</h3>
<p>
Use the following rules as a guideline for handling resources:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>When writing extensions, make sure they are defined and published</li>
 <li>When reading elements that can have modifier extensions, check whether they are any</li>
 <li>When reading elements ignore other extensions, unless you want to read a particular extension</li>
 <li>Retain extensions when ever you can</li>
</ul> 
 
<a name="define"></a>
<h2>Defining Extensions</h2>

<p>
Extensions may be defined by any project or jurisdiction, up to and including international standards organizations such as HL7 itself, and are published
as part of a <a href="profile.html">Resource Profile</a>. Extensions are always defined against some particular context - the type of element 
that they may be used to extend. The following are possible contexts for an extension:
</p>
<table class="codes">
 <tr><th>Context type</th><th>Context format</th><th>Examples</th></tr>
 <tr><td>A particular element (including the root) in a single resource</td><td>The element path for that element</td><td>Profile.resource.element; Person</td></tr>
 <tr><td>A particular element (including the root) in a particular data type</td><td>The data type name for primitive types or the element path for complex data types</td><td>Address.part.value; string</td></tr>
 <tr><td>A particular context in one of the mapped reference models</td><td>The name of the reference model followed by the mapping path</td><td>RIM: Act[moodCode="EVN"]</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Another extension</td><td>The profile uri of the extension followed by the extension code</td><td>http://myextensions.org#someExtension</td></tr>
 <tr><td>A set of some combination of the above</td><td>As above, separated by ';'</td><td>Address; Contact</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In addition, an extension definition might apply additional constraints with
regards to particular element values of the target that make its use appropriate.
Extensions SHALL only be used on a target for which they are defined.
</p>
<p>
Each extension is defined using the following fields:
</p>
<table class="codes">
 <tr><td>Code</td><td>Required</td><td>The name that is used as a code in a resource to identify this extension - unique in the context of the defining profile</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Context</td><td>Required</td><td>The context of this extension. See above. The context has two parts: a type, and a path which supplies the details</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Short Defn</td><td>Required</td><td>A brief description of the extension used in the XML descriptions when the extension is referenced in a profile</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Definition</td><td>Required</td><td>A formal statement of the meaning of the content of the field</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Requirements</td><td>Optional</td><td>Identifies the reason the extension is needed</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Comments</td><td>Optional</td><td>Additional other information about the extension, including information such as use notes</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Cardinality</td><td>Required</td><td>The cardinality of this extension.<br/> Specifying a minimum cardinality of 1 means that if the source system declares that it conforms to an extension that declares a type including this extension, this extension must be included in the resource.  Cardinality can be constrained but not loosened in profiles that reference this extension</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Type</td><td>Required</td><td>The type(s) of the extension. This SHALL be a valid FHIR data type as described above, or "Extension: x,y,z" which indicates that the extension codes x,y, and z will be contained in the extension</td></tr>
 <tr><td>XPaths</td><td>Optional</td><td>One or more XPath statements that SHALL evaluate to true when the extension is used</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Is Modifier</td><td>Required</td><td>Whether the extension changes the meaning or interpretation of the element containing the extension (or any descendant of that element). Extensions defined as IsModifier=true are always represented in <i>modifierExtension</i> elements, and extensions defined as IsModifier=false are always represented in <i>Extension</i> elements</td></tr>
 <tr><td>RIM Mapping</td><td>Conditional</td><td>The formal mapping from this extension to the RIM. Required for HL7-defined extensions that apply to resources with RIM mappings, but optional in other contexts</td></tr>
 <tr><td>v2 Mapping</td><td>Optional</td><td>Mapping to a v2 segment/field/etc., if desired and appropriate. </td></tr>
 <tr><td>Binding</td><td>Conditional</td><td>For the types CodeableConcept and Coding. See <a href="terminologies.html">Terminologies</a></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Mappings are not required to be computable (i.e. executable logic). Mappings to other specifications can also be provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Whenever resources containing extensions are exchanged, the definitions of the extensions SHALL be available to all the parties that share the resources.
Each extension contains a URI that references the source of the definitions as a Resource Profile. The source SHOULD be a literal reference, such as an
http: url that refers to an end-point that responds with the contents of the definitions - preferably a <a href="http.html">FHIR RESTful server</a>
supporting the Resources Profile, or a logical reference (e.g. using a urn:) - for instance, to a national published
standard.
</p>
<a name="definition"> </a>
<h2>Control of extensions</h2>
<p>
As well as defining the base element structure for resources, HL7 also publishes extensions. HL7 publishes data definitions
as extensions rather than as part of the base resource structure in order to keep the base
resource structure simple and concise, and to allow implementers not to engage with an entire world's
worth of functionality up front. Note that HL7 extensions are never flagged as must-understand - if
HL7 publishes resource content that where is-modifier=true, it will be part of the resource
content itself, since everyone has to understand the extension anyway.
</p>
<p>
Before extensions can be used in instances, they SHALL be published. HL7 maintains two
extension registries, and users are encouraged to register their extensions there. But
this is not required; all that is required is that the extension is published in a
context that is available for users of the extension. So, for example, if a particular
extension is used within a single institution, the definition of the extension
can be placed on the institution's intranet. However since, by their nature, resources
tend to travel well, it's always better to use the HL7 extension registries.
</p>
<p>
HL7 provides two extension registries. The first is for HL7 approved extensions. These
have been approved by an appropriate part of the HL7 community following a review process,
and have formal standing. The other registry is provided as a service to the community,
and anyone can register an extension on it.
</p>
<table class="codes">
 <tr><th>Registry</th><th>Search</th><th>Submit</th></tr>
 <tr><td>HL7 Approved</td><td>[TBD]</td><td>[TBD]</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Community</td><td>[TBD]</td><td>[TBD]</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Interim</td><td><a href="http://hl7connect.healthintersections.com.au/svc/fhir/profile/search">http://hl7connect.healthintersections.com.au/svc/fhir/profile/search</a></td>
 <td><a href="http://hl7connect.healthintersections.com.au/svc/fhir/profile/upload">http://hl7connect.healthintersections.com.au/svc/fhir/profile/upload</a></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
HL7 profiles defining extensions may be balloted alongside resource content as part of the FHIR specification or may
be published as part of separate specifications.
When HL7  publishes extensions as part of the FHIR specification, these extensions SHALL
be used for this data whenever the data is represented in instances. Applications SHOULD use other
HL7-defined extensions published to represent equivalent data in the interest of maximum interoperability.
If referencing a profile that defines extensions, implementations declaring conformance with the profile SHALL
use the profile-defined and imported extensions when conveying equivalent data elements.
</p>
<p>
To minimize complexity for implementers, HL7 will not elevate content defined in an HL7-approved extension to
be content defined in a core resource in future versions of the resource.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, an HL7 work group or other body may publish a profile whose sole
purpose is to define extensions expected to be needed by implementers in a particular context.  E.g. extensions needed
to map a particular set of v2 segments or a v3 model.
</p>
<p>
Implementations are encouraged to share their extensions with HL7 and register them with the HL7 extension registry. The domain committees will work
to elevate the extensions into HL7 published extensions or, if adopted by a broad enough portion of the implementer community, the into the base resource structure itself.
</p>
<!-- Todo: point to actual registry once it's up and running -->
<p>To avoid interoperability issues, extensions SHALL NOT change their definition once published.  (Small clarifications to descriptions
that do not affect interoperability are permitted.)  Rather than modifying an existing extension, a new extension should be introduced.
Revisions to an extension may extend the set of contexts in which the extension apply but may not remove or constrain any context previously listed</p>
<!-- Todo: Figure out how to manage "deprecating" extensions and pointing at their new versions -->
