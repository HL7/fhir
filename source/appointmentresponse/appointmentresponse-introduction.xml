<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p> 
Appointment resources are used to provide information about 
a planned meeting that may be in the future or past.  They may be for a single meeting or
for a series of repeating visits.  Examples include a scheduled surgery, a follow-up for a
clinical visit, a scheduled conference call between clinicians to discuss a case, the reservation
of a piece of diagnostic equipment for a particular use, etc.  The visit scheduled by an appointment
may be in person or remote (by phone, video conference, etc.)  All that matters is that the time and
usage of one or more individuals, locations and/or pieces of equipment is being fully or partially
reserved for a designated period of time.

		This definition takes the concepts of appointments in a clinical setting and also extends
		them to be relevant in the community healthcare space, and also ease exposure to other
		appointment / calendar standards widely used outside of Healthcare.
