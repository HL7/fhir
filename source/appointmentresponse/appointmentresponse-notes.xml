   <h2>Notes:</h2>
   <h3>Timezones and recurring appointments</h3>
    <p>Recurring appointments need to have the timezone defined in which the values were entered.
    Knowing that the start time was at 9:00:00Z+10 does not mean that the same time in 2 weeks is actually the same. 
    </p>
  <p>
    For example, if this was a time in Brisbane Australia, this time would be the same (in respect to its offset from UTC),
    however if this was for Melbourne Australia, during the daylight savings period Melbourne timezone becomes +11.
    So, without the additional information as to which timezone it was created in, scheduling a 9am appointment every
    Wednesday would not be possible.
