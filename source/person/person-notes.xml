Notes:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Person resource exists to enable Person registries that keep track of Persons regardless of their role. 
The Person resource is also a primary resource to point to for people acting in a particular role such as 
SubjectofCare, Practitioner and Agent. Very few attributes are specific to any role and so Person is kept lean. 
Most attributes are expected to be tied to the role the Person plays rather than the Person himself. 
Examples of that are Guardian (SubjectofCare), ContactParty (SubjectOfCare, Practitioner), 
and multipleBirthInd (SubjectofCare)</li>
