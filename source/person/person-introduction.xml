Ballot note: The Person resource does justice to Person registries that keep track of Persons regardless 
of their role. The Person resource is also a primary resource to point to for people acting in a particular role
such as SubjectofCare (formerly Patient), Practitioner and Agent. Very few attributes are specific to any role and
so Person is kept lean. Most attributes are expected to be tied to the role the Person plays rather than the 
Person himself. Examples of that are Guardian (SubjectofCare), ContactParty (SubjectOfCare, Practitioner), 
and multipleBirthInd (SubjectofCare).

Ballot note: The Person resource is the minimal set of information to carry about a person 
regardless of their role: the type of activity that a person is playing (patient, next of kin, practitioner, 
employee, etc.). As such is it is suitable for Person registries that keep track of Persons regardless 
of their role. The Person resource is referred to for person details for a variety of resources 
that represent a particular role, such as SubjectofCare (a.k.a Patient), Practitioner and Agent (a
person acting on behalf of an organization). Very few attributes are common to any role and
so the <i>Person</i> resource is kept lean. Most attributes are expected to be found in these other 
resources. (e.g.: guardian on SubjectofCare, contact parties on SubjectOfCare &amp; Practitioner, 
and multiple birth flag on SubjectofCare).
