<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<!-- PA original:
<p>

Ballot note: The Person resource does justice to Person registries that keep track of Persons regardless 
of their role. The Person resource is also a primary resource to point to for people acting in a particular role
such as SubjectofCare (formerly Patient), Practitioner and Agent. Very few attributes are specific to any role and
so Person is kept lean. Most attributes are expected to be tied to the role the Person plays rather than the 
Person himself. Examples of that are Guardian (SubjectofCare), ContactParty (SubjectOfCare, Practitioner), 
and multipleBirthInd (SubjectofCare).
</p>
-->
<p>
  A natural person has identity outside of a healthcare setting. The Person resource is used to capture this
  information and to relate the person as an individual to other resources that do have a health-related context.
</p>
  <p>
    For example, while a patient resource may be created and maintained by each organization providing care for that person as a patient, a person resource provides a mechanism for linking patient resources across different organizations and their unique patient identity domains. Additionally, a person resource may be used by organizations to allow patients to manage their demographic data while maintaining stricter control of the associated patient resource data.

    This resource is not referenced by any other resources.
