<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<p>
A referenced DICOM SOP instance could be:
<ul>
<li>A single- or multi-frame, still or video image captured by a variety of imaging modalities, such as X-ray, MR, and ultrasound;</li>
<li>A set of various presentation parameters, including annotation and markup;</li>
<li>A set of measurements or a report, including radiation dose report and CAD analysis;</li>
<li>An encapsulated PDF or CDA document;</li>
<li>A list of instances, such as key “of interest” images, or instances to be “deleted”; or </li>
<li>Other DICOM content. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
UID values follow the FHIR convention of expressing UIDs as URNs. For example, the DICOM Study Instance UID
of <code>1.2.250.1.59.40211.12345678.678910</code> is expressed as <code>“urn:oid:1.2.250.1.59.40211.12345678.678910”</code>.
</p>
<p>
The ImagingManifest.study.endpoint elements and ImagingManifest.study.series.endpoint elements indicate network 
services that can be used to access the studies, series, or instances; for example, a DICOM WADO-RS server. An 
ImagingManifest.study.series.endpoint of a particular Endpoint.connectionType provides that service for that 
series, and all contained instances. An ImagingManifest.study.endpoint of a particularconnection type provides 
that service for all series in that study that do not have a specified Endpoint of that type, and their 
contained instances. That is, an ImagingManifest.study.series.endpoint overrides a ImagingManifest.study.endpoint 
of the same connection type. (Since each study, or individual series of a study can be stored on different imaging 
archive servers, per-series endpoints are required. For the identified services and use cases, all instances within 
a series would be stored together, and thus instance-level endpoints are not defined.)
</p>
<p>
Different Endpoint connection types may have different capabilities, protocols or requirements; and the specified 
Endpoint.url may require manipulation. For the details on use of imaging-related Endpoint connection types, 
See <a href="imagingstudy.html#endpoint">ImagingStudy Implementation Notes</a> for details.

<h3>Use Case</h3>
<h4>EHR access to imaging studies</h4>
<p>
Amy, a family physician, is accessing a cross-enterprise document registry that contains
radiology objects (<a href="http://www.ihe.net">IHE Radiology XDS-I</a>), to discover studies for her patient, Alex.
Her EHR client makes a FHIR call for all <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a> objects available for
Alex. In the response, she is able to get study identifiers for each study that has
been published to the registry.
There is enough information provided in the response to obtain a thumbnail via a WADO-RS
call, or to launch a viewer using an <a href="http://www.ihe.net">IHE Radiology - Invoke Image Display (IID)</a>
profile call using the url elements found in the <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a>.
In each result, there is a reference to
the <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> FHIR object which can provide more information about each study.
</p>
<h4>Comprehensive Imaging Scheduled Workflow</h4>
<p>
Joe Angina complains of shortness of breath and occasional chest pain to his primary care physician, Dr. Pat Down at
Local MultiClinic, who orders a stress echocardiogram; the order is created as a FHIR <a href="task.html">Task</a>
resource to manage the workflow, with a link to a <a href="procedurerequest.html">ProcedureRequest</a> resource with
the details of the request.   The order is scheduled and assigned to cardiologist Dr. Art Skann, also at Local MultiClinic.
</p>
<p>
On the scheduled day of the exam, Joe arrives at the echo lab to meet with Dr. Skann and have the study done.
Dr. Skann’s workstation shows the daily list of <a href="task.html">Task</a>, and he follows the link to retrieve the
<a href="procedurerequest.html">ProcedureRequest</a>. (He may follow the links through the 
referenced <a href="patient.html">Patient</a> resource to access Joe’s electronic
medical record, but that is not the concern of this storyboard.)
</p>
<p>
The <a href="task.html">Task</a> and <a href="procedurerequest.html">ProcedureRequest</a> has been transcoded to a DICOM Modality Worklist
Scheduled Procedure Step, and in the echo lab the equipment has downloaded the Modality Worklist.  The
study is performed, and the acquired images and sonographer’s preliminary measurements are stored in the
Local MultiClinic Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).  The PACS creates
an <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> resource for each study it manages.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Skann interprets the study on a PACS workstation, and he selects two key image frames to be included
in the diagnostic report; this selection is stored back to the PACS as a DICOM Key Object Selection with
the title "For Report Attachment", and the PACS makes it available (transcodes it) as a
FHIR <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a> resource.  Dr. Skann dictates the
report using a structured data entry report writing program, including a recommendation for a cardiac
catheterization procedure, and signs it.  The report writing program formats the report
as a <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">CDA</a> document,
retrieves the <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a> resource, and inserts the
referenced key images into the report.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Down meets again with Joe, and they review the results of the stress test.  Joe has a question about
the findings that the key images in the report do not show, so Dr. Down uses the Local MultiClinic EMR
to query the PACS for the full <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> resource, and uses the references there to open an image
display for the full study.  Joe agrees to proceed to catheterization, and Dr. Down sends a referral to
the Ginormous University Hospital cath department, and triggers the PACS to share the echo study
through the Metropolitan Health Information Exchange.
</p>
<p>
The PACS creates a manifest of the study as an <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a>
resource, which includes all the
images but excludes the sonographer’s preliminary measurements (which as a matter of policy are
not shared outside the Local MultiClinic). The manifest is published to the Metro HIE. (In
accordance with <a href="http://www.ihe.net">IHE XDS-I</a>, the images themselves are not directly
published to the HIE, but available for on-demand retrieval from the PACS.)
</p>
<p>
At Ginormous Hospital, Dr. Cora Plummer receives the cath referral, and looks up the study in the
Metro HIE registry.  She retrieves the study manifest <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a>,
and uses it to access the shared images, which she uses to prepare for the cath procedure.
