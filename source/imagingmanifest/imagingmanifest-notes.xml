<h3>Use Case</h3>
<h4>EHR access to imaging studies</h4>
<p>
Amy, a family physician, is accessing a cross-enterprise document registry that contains 
radiology objects (<a href="http://www.ihe.net">IHE Radiology XDS-I</a>), to discover studies for her patient, Alex. 
Her EHR client makes a FHIR call for all <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a> objects available for 
Alex. In the response, she is able to get study identifiers for each study that has 
been published to the registry. 
There is enough information provided in the response to obtain a thumbnail via a WADO-RS 
call, or to launch a viewer using an <a href="http://www.ihe.net">IHE Radiology - Invoke Image Display (IID)</a> 
profile call using the url elements found in the <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a>.
In each result, there is a reference to 
the <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> FHIR object which can provide more information about each study.
</p>
<h4>Comprehensive Imaging Scheduled Workflow</h4>
<p>
Joe Angina complains of shortness of breath and occasional chest pain to his primary care physician, Dr. Pat Down at 
Local MultiClinic, who orders a stress echocardiogram; the order is created as a FHIR <a href="order.html">Order</a> 
resource to manage the workflow, with a link to a <a href="diagnosticorder.html">DiagnosticOrder</a> resource with 
the details of the request.   The order is scheduled and assigned to cardiologist Dr. Art Skann, also at Local MultiClinic.   
</p>
<p>
On the scheduled day of the exam, Joe arrives at the echo lab to meet with Dr. Skann and have the study done.  
Dr. Skann’s workstation shows the daily list of <a href="order.html">Order</a>, and he follows the link to retrieve the 
<a href="diagnosticorder.html">DiagnosticOrder</a>. (He may follow the links through the 
referenced <a href="patient.html">Patient</a> resource to access Joe’s electronic 
medical record, but that is not the concern of this storyboard.)  
</p>
<p>
The <a href="order.html">Order</a> and <a href="diagnosticorder.html">DiagnosticOrder</a> has been transcoded to a DICOM Modality Worklist 
Scheduled Procedure Step, and in the echo lab the equipment has downloaded the Modality Worklist.  The 
study is performed, and the acquired images and sonographer’s preliminary measurements are stored in the 
Local MultiClinic Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).  The PACS creates 
an <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> resource for each study it manages.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Skann interprets the study on a PACS workstation, and he selects two key image frames to be included 
in the diagnostic report; this selection is stored back to the PACS as a DICOM Key Object Selection with 
the title "For Report Attachment", and the PACS makes it available (transcodes it) as a 
FHIR <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a> resource.  Dr. Skann dictates the 
report using a structured data entry report writing program, including a recommendation for a cardiac 
catheterization procedure, and signs it.  The report writing program formats the report 
as a <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">CDA</a> document, 
retrieves the <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a> resource, and inserts the 
referenced key images into the report.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Down meets again with Joe, and they review the results of the stress test.  Joe has a question about 
the findings that the key images in the report do not show, so Dr. Down uses the Local MultiClinic EMR 
to query the PACS for the full <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> resource, and uses the references there to open an image 
display for the full study.  Joe agrees to proceed to catheterization, and Dr. Down sends a referral to 
the Ginormous University Hospital cath department, and triggers the PACS to share the echo study 
through the Metropolitan Health Information Exchange.  
</p>
<p>
The PACS creates a manifest of the study as an <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a> 
resource, which includes all the 
images but excludes the sonographer’s preliminary measurements (which as a matter of policy are 
not shared outside the Local MultiClinic). The manifest is published to the Metro HIE. (In 
accordance with <a href="http://www.ihe.net">IHE XDS-I</a>, the images themselves are not directly 
published to the HIE, but available for on-demand retrieval from the PACS.)
</p>
<p>
At Ginormous Hospital, Dr. Cora Plummer receives the cath referral, and looks up the study in the 
Metro HIE registry.  She retrieves the study manifest <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a>, 
and uses it to access the shared images, which she uses to prepare for the cath procedure.
