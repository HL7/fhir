<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
A <b>Questionnaire</b> is an organized collection of questions intended to solicit information from patients, providers or other individuals involved
in the healthcare domain.  They may be simple flat lists of questions or can be hierarchically organized in
groups and sub-groups, each containing questions.  The <b>Questionnaire</b> defines the questions to be asked, how they are ordered and grouped, any
intervening instructional text and what
the constraints are on the allowed answers.  The results of a <b>Questionnaire</b> can be communicated using the <a href="questionnaireresponse.html">QuestionnaireResponse</a> resource.
</p>
<p>
Questionnaires cover the need to communicate data originating from forms used in medical history examinations, research questionnaires and sometimes full
clinical specialty records. In many systems this data is collected using user-defined screens and forms. Questionnaires define specifics about data capture -
exactly what questions were asked, in what order, what choices for answers were, etc. Each of these questions is part of the Questionnaire,
and as such the Questionnaire is a separately identifiable Resource, whereas the individual questions are not.  (Questionnaire questions can be linked to
shared data elements using the <code>Questionnaire.item.definition</code> element.)
</p>
<p>
In addition to its use as a means for capturing data, Questionnaires can also be useful as a mechanism of defining a standardized 'presentation' of 
data that might already exist.  For example, a peri-natal form or diabetes management form.  In this use, the benefit is to expose a large volume of 
data in a predictable way that can be defined outside the user-interface design of the relevant system.  The form might allow data to be edited or 
might be read-only.  In some cases, the QuestionnaireResponse might not be intended to be persisted.
</p>
<p>Examples of Questionnaires include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Past medical history (PMH)</li>
<li>Family diseases</li>
<li>Social history</li>
<li>Research questionnaires/Clinical research forms (CRFs)</li>
<li>Quality and evaluation forms</li>
<li>Patient intake form (e.g. clipboard)</li>
<li>Forms to support insurance claims</li>
</ul>
<p>
This resource is limited in scope to support the characteristics of simple questionnaires.  However, common extensions have been defined to allow more
sophisticated behavior.  This includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="questionnaire-core.html">Questionnaire core extensions</a> which defines the additional descriptive characteristics for questionnaires and their groups and questions</li>
  <li><a href="element-extensions.html">Element extensions</a> which can describe additional constraints on allowed answers for questionnaires such as string length and date and numeric ranges</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additional implementation guides, in particular the <a href="#sdc">Structured Data Capture Questionnaire IG</a> provide guidance, extensions and operations
that support additional capabilities and allow the definition of more sophisticated questionnaires and their corresponding responses.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
<b>Questionnaires</b> differ from <a href="list.html">Lists</a> because <a href="list.html">Lists</a> group existing resources, while <b>Questionnaires</b> group
arbitrary questions.
Questionnaires are distinct from <a href="observation.html">Observations</a> and <a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReports</a> in that both of these resources are
intended to capture only certain types of information (lab, imaging, vitals, etc.) and should not be used to capture the full breadth of healthcare information (allergies,
medications, care plans, etc.), while Questionnaires are able to capture any information at all.  More importantly, Observation and DiagnosticReport focus on capturing the
discrete information in a standardized form so that the information can be used consistently regardless of where or how it is captured.  Questionnaire focuses on information
capture.  The same information can be captured using a wide variety of questionnaires with differently phrased questions organized in different manners.  As such, the
Questionnaire resource provides a means to standardize the information gathering process (how information is captured), but not how data is interoperably compared, analyzed
or computed upon (typically managed using Observation, DiagnosticReport as well as other resources).
</p>
<p>
Questionnaire supports data-collection workflow to a limited extent, in that - once triggered - a Questionnaire can guide a user through a data collection process that ensures
appropriate information is collected based on answers to particular questions.  However, Questionnaire doesn't provide support for capturing sets of information at different
times or highly interactive data capture.  Broader workflow is typically managed using PlanDefinition and Task or using other mechanisms such as CDSHooks.
</p>
<p>
Questionnaires are similar to the notion of "logical models" supported by the <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a> resource.  Both support the representation
of a collection of data points with labels, data types and hierarchy.  It will be common to find the two of them mapped together.  The primary difference is that Questionnaire
is focused on user-facing data collection.  It describes specific questions and includes information such as what number/label should be displayed beside each question,
conditions in which questions should be displayed (or not), what instructions should be provided to the user, etc.  StructureDefinition, on the other hand, merely defines a
data structure with no guidance on display or rules around capture mechanism, only what data should exist in the end.  As well, logical models are not intended to capture
data directly.  Rather, they provide a basis for mapping between data capture structures.
</p>
<p>
Questionnaires are excellent tools for data capture.  They allow tight control over what data is gathered and ensure information is gathered consistently across multiple users.  
However, data gathered using different questionnaires - or even different versions of the same questionnaire - is often not comparable.  It is also not very searchable or easily 
integrated with discrete data sources.  Because of this, the general recommendation in FHIR is to use questionnaires for raw data capture but then to convert the resulting 
QuestionnaireResponse instances into other FHIR resources - Observations, MedicationStatements, FamilyMemberHistories, etc.  This allows the data gathered to then be easily 
combined with other data into FHIR documents and messages and exposed over FHIR REST interfaces.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
Groups and questions that make up a Questionnaire can use the <code>definition</code> element to refer to data elements in external code systems and <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinitions</a>.  In this way, it's possible to leverage standard definitions
of questions and their associated data types and answer sets across questionnaires. This also allows extraction of the data from a questionnaire response into other data
structures (e.g. populating a <a href="servicerequest.html">ServiceRequest</a> or <a href="careplan.html">CarePlan</a> from information in a completed questionnaire response.
It can also support other sorts of post-processing of the data contained in a questionnaire response. However, use of the definition element is not required
and Questionnaires may be quite loosely defined. The section <a href="#qversusr">Questionnaire versus Resources</a> below discusses the issues of collecting data in such
loosely defined Questionnaires versus collecting data as well-defined separate Resources.
