<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
A <b>Questionnaire</b> is an organized collection of questions intended to solicit information from patients, providers or other individuals involved
in the healthcare domain.  They may be simple flat lists of questions or can be hierarchically organized in 
groups and sub-groups, each containing questions.  The <b>Questionnaire</b> defines the questions to be asked, how they are ordered and grouped, any
intervening instructional text and what
the constraints are on the allowed answers.  The results of a <b>Questionnaire</b> can be communicated using the <a href="questionnaireresponse.html">QuestionnaireResponse</a> resource.
</p>
<p>
Questionnaires cover the need to communicate data originating from forms used in medical history examinations, research questionnaires and sometimes full
clinical specialty records. In many systems this data is collected using user-defined screens and forms. Questionnaires define specifics about data capture -
exactly what questions were asked, in what order, what choices for answers were, etc. Each of these questions is part of the Questionnaire, 
and as such the Questionnaire is a separately identifiable Resource, whereas the individual questions are not.  (Questionnaire questions can be linked to
shared data elements using the <code>Questionnaire.item.definition</code> element.)
</p>
<p>Examples of Questionnaires include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Past medical history (PMH)</li>
<li>Family diseases</li>
<li>Social history</li>
<li>Research questionnaires/Clinical research forms (CRFs)</li>
<li>Quality and evaluation forms</li>
<li>Patient intake form (e.g. clipboard)</li>
<li>Insurance claim form</li>
</ul>
<p>
This resource is limited in scope to support the characteristics of simple questionnaires.  However, common extensions have been defined to allow more
sophisticated behavior.  This includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="questionnaire-extensions.html">Questionnaire core extensions</a> which defines the additional descriptive characteristics for questionnaires and their groups and questions</li>
  <li><a href="element-extensions.html">Element extensions</a> which can describe additional constraints on allowed answers for questionnaires such as string length and date and numeric ranges</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additional profiles such as the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/sdc/questionnaire-sdc.html">Structured Data Capture Questionnaire profile</a> may provide additional capabilities for defining
more sophisticated questionnaires and forms.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
<b>Questionnaires</b> differ from <a href="list.html">Lists</a> because <a href="list.html">Lists</a> group existing resources, while <b>Questionnaires</b> group
arbitrary questions.  In theory, a <b>Questionnaire</b> could be expressed as a <a href="list.html">List</a> or <a href="composition.html">Composition</a> containing
<a href="dataelement.html">DataElement</a> resources.  However, the former would disregard the "wholeness" associated with a questionnaire where questions 
must generally be maintained as a single structure.  The latter would focus on rendering of the data elements rather than organizing the capture of information.
</p>
<p>
Questionnaires are distinct from <a href="observation.html">Observations</a> and <a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReports</a> in that both of these resources are
intended to capture only certain types of information (lab, imaging, vitals, etc.) and should not be used to capture the full breadth of healthcare information (allergies,
medications, care plans, etc.), while Questionnaires are able to capture any information at all.  More importantly, Observation and DiagnosticReport focus on capturing the
discrete information in a standardized form so that the information can be used consistently regardless of where or how it is captured.  Questionnaire focuses on information
capture.  The same information can be captured using a wide variety of questionnaires with differently phrased questions organized in different manners.  As such, the
Questionnaire resource provides a means to standardize the information gathering process (how information is captured), but not the actual information collected.  Observation 
and DiagnosticReport standardize what information is actually captured, but not how the information is gathered.
</p>
<p>
Questionnaires are similar to the notion of "logical models" supported by the <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a> resource.  Both support the representation
of a collection of data points with labels, data types and hierarchy.  It will be common to find the two of them mapped together.  The primary difference is that Questionnaire
is focused on user-facing data collection.  It describes specific questions and includes information such as what number/label should be displayed beside each question,
conditions in which questions should be displayed (or not), what instructions should be provided to the user, etc.  StructureDefinition, on the other hand, merely defines a
data structure with no guidance on display or rules around capture mechanism, only what data should exist in the end.  As well, logical models are not intended to capture
data directly.  Rather, they provide a basis for mapping between data capture structures.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
Groups and questions that make up a Questionnaire can use the <code>definition</code> element to refer to data elements in external code systems, 
<a href="dataelement.html">DataElements</a> and <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinitions</a>.  In this way, it's possible to leverage standard definitions
of questions and their associated data types and answer sets across questionnaires. This also allows extraction of the data from a questionnaire response into other data
structures (e.g. populating a <a href="referralrequest.html">ReferralRequest</a> or <a href="careplan.html">CarePlan</a> from information in a completed questionnaire response.
It can also support other sorts of post-processing of the data contained in a questionnaire response. However, use of the definition element is not required 
and Questionnaires may be quite loosely defined. The section <a href="#qversusr">Questionnaire versus Resources</a> below discusses the issues of collecting data in such
loosely defined Questionnaires versus collecting data as well-defined separate Resources.
