(M1020/1022/1024) Diagnoses, Symptom Control, and Payment Diagnoses: List each diagnosis for which the
patient is receiving home care (Column 1) and enter its ICD-9-C M code at the level of highest specificity (no
surgical/procedure codes) (Column 2). Diagnoses are listed in the order that best reflect the seriousness of each condition
and support the disciplines and services provided. Rate the degree of symptom control for each condition (Column 2).
Choose one value that represents the degree of symptom control appropriate for each diagnosis: V-codes (for M1020 or
M1022) or E-codes (for M1022 only) may be used. ICD-9-C M sequencing requirements must be followed if multiple
coding is indicated for any diagnoses. If a V-code is reported in place of a case mix diagnosis, then optional item M1024
Payment Diagnoses (Columns 3 and 4) may be completed. A case mix diagnosis is a diagnosis that determines the
Medicare P P S case mix group. Do not assign symptom control ratings for V- or E-codes.
Code each row according to the following directions for each column:
Column 1: Enter the description of the diagnosis.
Column 2: Enter the ICD-9-C M code for the diagnosis described in Column 1;
Rate the degree of symptom control for the condition listed in Column 1 using the following scale:
0 - Asymptomatic, no treatment needed at this time
1 - Symptoms well controlled with current therapy
2 - Symptoms controlled with difficulty, affecting daily functioning; patient needs ongoing monitoring
3 - Symptoms poorly controlled; patient needs frequent adjustment in treatment and dose monitoring
4 - Symptoms poorly controlled; history of re-hospitalizations
Note that in Column 2 the rating for symptom control of each diagnosis should not be used to determine the
sequencing of the diagnoses listed in Column 1. These are separate items and sequencing might not coincide.
Sequencing of diagnoses should reflect the seriousness of each condition and support the disciplines and services
provided.
Column 3: (OPTIONAL) If a V-code is assigned to any row in Column 2, in place of a case mix diagnosis, it may be
necessary to complete optional item M1024 Payment Diagnoses (Columns 3 and 4). See OASIS-C Guidance
Manual.
Column 4: (OPTIONAL) If a V-code in Column 2 is reported in place of a case mix diagnosis that requires multiple
diagnosis codes under ICD-9-C M coding guidelines, enter the diagnosis descriptions and the ICD-9-C M codes in
the same row in Columns 3 and 4. For example, if the case mix diagnosis is a manifestation code, record the
diagnosis description and ICD-9-C M code for the underlying condition in Column 3 of that row and the diagnosis
description and ICD-9-C M code for the manifestation in Column 4 of that row. Otherwise, leave Column 4 blank in
that row.

Diagnoses
(Sequencing of diagnoses should
reflect the seriousness of each
condition and support the
disciplines and services provided.)
ICD-9-C M and symptom
control rating for each
condition.
Note that the sequencing of
these ratings might not match
the sequencing of the
diagnoses
Complete if a V-code is
assigned under certain
circumstances to Column 2
in place of a case mix
diagnosis.
Complete only if the V-code
in Column 2 is reported in
place of a case mix
diagnosis that is a multiple
coding situation (e.g. a
manifestation code).
