Notes:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>The information on questionnaires can be collected during several interactions with the patient, and there for amended and changed over time. The
Questionnaire.status attribute is used to support this lifecycle.</li>
<li>Questionnaires can be authored by clinicians, the patient his/herself or a patients relatives (or even owner in the case of animals). Clinicians
may author questionnaires, where the answers are provided by others on behalf of the patient his/herself. Addtionally, information gathered for the
purpose of a patient may be about the patient's relatives (e.g. in family anamnesis). Therefore, Questionnaire makes a distinction between the author,
the subject and the source of information.</li>
<li>Questionnaires often correspond to predefined forms, which may be recorded using Questionnaire.name. Questionnaires.identifier identify a specific
set of answers to the questions on these forms.</li>
<li>Questionnaires may directly contain anwers and/or contain sections and subsections with answers. These may or may not correspond to the structure
of the original form. If they do correspond, sections and subsections may be named, so answers on a Questionnaire can refer to the section on the form.
Likewise, Answers on Questionnaires can be named to refer to the question on a form. As mentioned in the introduction, it is also possible to
include the actual text of the questions posed with the answers.</li>
<li>Since sections and questions may be answered multiple times, the same Section.name and Answer.name may appear multiple times.</li>
<li>As described in the introduction, answers may simple be numeric values, coded answers and text, but this atomic information may be based on or replaced
by actual Observations, Procedures and other resources.</li>
<li>Questionnaire allows for flexible naming and structuring of its contents to reflect the flexible and varying nature of forms and questionnaires. 
It explicitly does not try to standardize or streamline exchange of its contents outside its context of use, although exchanging partners may further
constrain its structure and flexibility using profiles to define standardized, reusable forms.</li>
<li>Because of the lack of explicit support for Questionnaires in HL7v3, HL7 CDA Documents frequently used named sections with
Observations to model Questionnaires, such usecases should now utilize the Questionnaire Resource instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>
TODO: Decide on whether we need an explicit Answer.omitReason to indicate the fact that (and the reason why) a question on a form remain unanswered.
Gives the flexibility to support both just sending the answered questions or exchanging the "full" form, on which each question is either answered
or explicitly omitted.</p>
