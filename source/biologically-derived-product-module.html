    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        This module outlines the resources and functionality used to model biologically derived products (BDP) that have specific requirements for traceability and allocation. The Biologically Derived Product is used to track biological products of human or non-human origin intended to be transplanted or infused into a human.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of products of human origin (referred to as Medical Products of Human Origin, or MPHO) include: blood for transfusion; blood and marrow for cellular therapy; organs, cornea, vascular tissue, bone, tendons, and other tissues for transplantation; banked human milk; and, serum eye drops.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of non-human derived products include: porcine dermis and porcine heart valves.
    </p>
    <p>
        In most countries BDP are regulated separately from medicines and medical devices and have specific traceability requirements including the need to be able to trace back to the donor, and the need to retain traceability records for very long periods (e.g. 30 years from time of use for tissues and cells clinically applied in the EU).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some BDP are regulated as medical devices in some jurisdictions and these may need to be managed through the Medical Devices module in FHIR. Traceability and lookback functionality will need to take into account that material from a single donation event may result in products that are managed as both biologics and medical devices. Care will need to be taken when products cross international boundaries as the regulatory framework may change, thus a product regulated as a medical device in the US may be regulated as Tissues and Cells in the EU.
    </p>
    <p>
        For BDP derived from a human donor (an MPHO) bi-directional traceability is essential. A profile for MPHO has been developed that specifies that essential traceability identifiers are required.
    </p>

    <strong style="color:red">Important Notes:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For BDP derived from a human donor, traceability between donor and recipient has to be maintained. Models described in this module support traceability. If alternative models are used then care must be taken to ensure the traceability pathway is maintained.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <p>The diagram below illustrates the information flow associated with BDP use from clinical request and provision from supplier through to clinical application into the patient. This example demonstrates how traceability and allocation requirements can be supported with responsibility for the BDP being maintained by a custodial entity.</p>

                    The BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource (BDP) is the resource that carries the information specific to an individual product of biological origin.

                    This resource carries a unique identifier together with elements for the donation identification number, product description code and the division number. These are essential for BDP of human origin to ensure globally unique identification and to meet traceability requirements.

                    The BDP carries information on important characteristics of the product (e.g. blood group; expiration date; red cell antigen profile; collection type; CMV status).

        There is a degree of flexibility expected with this resource given the wide variety of biologically derived products used in different areas of medicine. For example, the scenario described above includes the use of the SupplyDelivery resource to indicate a BDP being received from an external provider, but the biologically derived product could also originate through a collection event in a surgical suite or apheresis unit in the same facility where the patient is receiving treatment.
    </p>

    <a name="exampleworkflows"></a>
    <h3>Example Workflows</h3>

    <a name="example-celltherapy"></a>
    <h4>Cellular Therapy</h4>
    <p>It is possible for a ServiceRequest to specify a collection event (procedure) and then a subsequent ServiceRequest for the BDPDispense and infusion (procedure). The procedure would collect from the donor patient and result in a BDP that could later be dispensed to the recipient patient. This is a common occurrence for standard of care blood and marrow transplant (BMT) centers that find a matching donor for an intended recipient, collect healthy blood-forming stem cells, and infuse those cells into a recipient patient. For some indications it is also common for stem cells to be collected from a patient prior to them receiving other treatments (e.g. chemotherapy, radiation), with the cryopreserved cells later being thawed and infused back into the patient.</p>
    <img src="biologicallyderivedproduct-module-celltherapyexample.png" alt="Image showing the usage of the Biologically Derived Product and related resources for cell therapy" />
    <br />

    <b>Example: Autologous stem cell transplant that uses pre-treatment healthy stem cells from a patient's own body after a treatment has damaged their bone marrow</b>
    <ol>
        <li>
            BMT clinical team orders the Hospital Transfusion/Cell Therapy Laboratory to collect stem cells from the patient (ServiceRequest). This will include specifying any regimens required such as stem cell mobilization drugs or scheduling requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
            The stem cells are collected from the patient (as many as possible) and cryopreserved for future use (Procedure). This may involve a surgical suite (bone marrow) or apheresis unit (peripheral blood) but the ultimate chain of custody of the product resides with the laboratory. There will commonly be multiple biologically derived product instances as a result of collection.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Hospital Transfusion/Cell Therapy Laboratory processes the stem cells based on the unique needs of the intended recipient. In standard of care applications this could mean plasma reduction while in advanced applications this could include ex vivo expansion or further specialized processing.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Hospital Transfusion/Cell Therapy Laboratory advises the BMT clinical team that cryopreserved products are available in inventory, are medically releasable, and have desired characteristics for purity and potency of the stem cells.
        </li>
        <li>
            The BMT clinical team orders infusion of one or more biologically derived products depending on the dosing needs of the recipient (ServiceRequest and then BiologicallyDerivedProductDispense). This will be scheduled to occur within the context of a larger treatment plan involving a variety of allied health professionals in addition to treatment-specific regimens such as chemotherapy or radiation.
        </li>
        <li>
            The stem cells are infused into the patient and long-term follow-up begins (Procedure). For some kinds of transplant (myeloablative) the timing of this is critical as the patient will effectively have no surviving bone marrow until the stem cells have engrafted which can take upwards of three weeks.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <b>Example: Allogeneic stem cell transplant that uses healthy stem cells from a healthy donor to replace bone marrow that is not producing healthy blood cells</b>
    <ol>
        <li>
            BMT clinical team orders human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing for intended recipient and potential donors to identify if a suitable healthy donor exists. The donor matching may occur through the hospital network or an international registry soliciting stem cell donors on a global basis. This step is relevant for context purposes but is out of scope for the BDP FHIR resources and is not included in the related diagrams.
        </li>
        <li>
            BMT clinical team orders the Hospital Transfusion/Cell Therapy Laboratory to collect stem cells from the selected donor (ServiceRequest). This will include specifying any regimens required such as stem cell mobilization drugs or scheduling requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
            The stem cells are collected from the donor (as many as possible) (Procedure). This may involve a surgical suite (bone marrow) or apheresis unit (peripheral blood) but the ultimate chain of custody of the product resides with the laboratory. There will commonly be multiple biologically derived product instances as a result of collection.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Hospital Transfusion/Cell Therapy Laboratory processes the stem cells based on the unique needs of the intended recipient. In standard of care applications this could mean plasma reduction or RBC depletion while in advanced applications this could include ex vivo expansion or further specialized processing. (not shown in the diagram)
        </li>
        <li>
            The Hospital Transfusion/Cell Therapy Laboratory advises the BMT clinical team that the fresh or cryopreserved products are available in inventory, are medically releasable, and have desired characteristics for purity and potency of the stem cells.
        </li>
        <li>
            The BMT clinical team orders infusion of one or more biologically derived products depending on the dosing needs of the recipient (ServiceRequest and then BiologicallyDerivedProductDispense). This will be scheduled to occur within the context of a larger treatment plan involving a variety of allied health professionals in addition to treatment-specific regimens such as chemotherapy or radiation.
        </li>
        <li>
            The stem cells are infused into the patient and long-term follow-up begins (Procedure). For some kinds of transplant (myeloablative) the timing of this is critical as the patient will effectively have no surviving bone marrow until the stem cells have engrafted which can take upwards of three weeks.

    <h4>Cornea Transplant</h4>
    <p>The example below follows the General Usage workflow shown above, but provides more detail specific to cornea transplantation.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Eye surgeon identifies need for cornea replacement and determines appropriate cornea replacement procedure.
        </li>
        <li>
            Eye surgeon requests required cornea graft from eye bank and provides necessary specifications. (ServiceRequest).
        </li>
        <li>
            Eye bank sources cornea and dispatches to BDP custodian (BiologicallyDerivedProductDispense).
        </li>
        <li>
            The tissue is delivered to the eye clinic BDP custodian (usually an appointed nurse, or the chief nurse of the operating theatre, or transfusion laboratory staff).
        </li>
        <li>
            Surgeon implants cornea (Procedure)
        </li>

    <p>The examples below follow the General Usage workflow shown above, but provide more detail specific to blood transfusion.</p>

    <b>Example: Transfusion of platelets</b>
    <ol>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Transfusion laboratory selects suitable platelet units from stock and allocates them for the patient (BiologicallyDerivedProductDispense).
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Blood center dispatches a consignment of products to the transfusion laboratory (SupplyDelivery).
        </li>
    </ol>

    <b>Example: Blood transfusion for patient with antibodies.</b>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The patient's clinician identifies the need for a blood transfusion and requests 3 units of red cells (ServiceRequest).
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfusion laboratory orders blood specimens to be collected from the patient.
        </li>
        <li>

    </ul>
    <p>In the context of blood transfusion, observations based on tests performed on specimens collected from the patient fulfil a number of important roles:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>To help determine the need for the clinical application of a BDP (e.g. platelet count on patient specimen gives indication if platelet transfusion is required)</li>
        <li>To determine important serological information about the patient prior to transfusion (blood group of patient, presence of atypical antibodies)</li>
        <li>To ensure the selection of safe product for the patient (e.g. blood crossmatch using a patient specimen ensures compatibility between red blood cell units and patient)</li>
        <li>Follow-up specimen collection can provide information on efficacy of treatment and the need for additional clinical support (e.g. post-transfusion platelet count can indicate effectiveness of platelet therapy)</li>
        <li>Investigation of suspected transfusion reaction will involve the analysis of pre- and post- transfusion specimens</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
    <p>
        The Biologically Derived Product resources typically represent patient-specific data, and as such are susceptible to data breaching.
        Necessary privacy and security provisions must be in place when searching and fetching this information. For
        more general considerations, see <a href="secpriv-module.html">the Security and Privacy module</a>.

    <h3>Developmental Roadmap</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The <em>Biologically Derived Product</em> resource had relatively significant changes leading up to the R5 release, and is still immature at FMM=2. We anticipate that future work could lead to further refinements in the scope and boundaries. Broader use by implementers will help to increase its maturity level.</li>
        <li>The <em>Biologically Derived Product Dispense</em> resource was introduced in R5. Further use of this resource in production tooling is needed for it to reach a more stable FMM level.</li>
    </ul>
