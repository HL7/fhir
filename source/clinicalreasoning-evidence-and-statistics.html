<h3>Evidence and Statistics</h3>

<a name="introduction"> </a>
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<a name="scope"> </a>
<h5>Scope</h5>

<p>The reporting of biomedical evidence is the reporting of facts and interpretations derived from analysis of observations of members of a group.  The certainty of the ‘facts’ may vary due to many factors including methodological factors, statistical factors, contextual factors, and the relatedness between the group the evidence was derived from and the group the interpretation is intended for.</p>

<a name="audience"> </a>
<h5>Audience</h5>

<p>The evidence processing and guideline development communities represent a substantial volume of knowledge management effort (Cochrane alone has more than 30,000 people working on development of systematic reviews of clinical research).</p>

<p>The broad communities producing, analyzing, synthesizing, disseminating and implementing clinical research (evidence) and recommendations for clinical care (clinical practice guidelines) frequently send or receive biomedical evidence reports.</p>

<a name="purpose"> </a>
<h5>Purpose</h5>

<p>The co-primary objectives of the Evidence-Based Medicine on FHIR Project are to meet the needs of the evidence processing and guideline development communities and to facilitate interoperability between these communities and the patient care communities.</p>

<h4>PICO vs. Statistically-defined evidence variables</h4>

<p>In the EBM communities (evidence analysis, systematic reviews, clinical practice guidelines) a common organizational framework used for the research question, the systematic review focus, and the recommendation focus is PICO which stands for Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome.   There are variations such as PECO for research questions about non-interventional exposures, PICOT for adding time conventions, and PICOTS for adding system context, but PICO is the most prominent organizational framework across the EBM knowledge assets activities.</p>
