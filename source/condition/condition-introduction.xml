This resource is used to record detailed information about a specific aspect of or issue with 
the health state of a patient. It is intended for use for issues that have been 
identified as relevant for tracking and reporting purposes or where there's a 
need to capture a concrete diagnosis or the gathering of data such as signs and 
symptoms.  There are situations where the same information might 
appear as both an observation as well as a condition.  For example, the 
appearance of a rash or an instance of a fever are signs and symptoms that 
would typically be captured using the Observation resource.  However, a 
pattern of ongoing fevers or a persistent or severe rash requiring treatment 
might be captured as a condition.  The Condition resource specifically 
excludes AdverseReactions and AllergyIntolerances as those are handled 
with their own resources.
</p>
<p>
Condition may be used to record positive aspects of the health state
of a patient as well as the major use, which is for problems/concerns.
</p>
<p>
Conditions are frequently referenced by other resources as "reasons" for 
an action (Prescription, Procedure, DiagnosticOrder, etc.)
</p>
<p>
The conditions represented in this resources are sometimes described as 
"Problems", and kept as part of a problem list.
