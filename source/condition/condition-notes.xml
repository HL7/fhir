<h3>Use of Condition.code</h3>

<p>
Many of the code systems used for coding conditions will provide codes that define not only the condition itself, but may 
also specify a particular stage, location, or causality as part of the code. This is particularly true if 
SNOMED CT is used for the condition, and especially if expressions are allowed. 
</p>
<p>
When the Condition.code specifies additional properties of the condition, the other properties are not given 
a value - instead, the value must be understood from the Condition.code.
