  <h2>Definition extensions</h2>
  <p>
    Not all resources that adhere to the Definition pattern will necessarily include all pattern elements as 'core' elements.  This guide defines
    extensions for certain pattern elements that may be relevant but are not supported widely enough for direct inclusion in some resources.
    The extensions relevant for 'definition' resources can be found in the <a href="workflow-extensions.html">Workflow pattern extensions</a> section 
    of this specification.

  <h2>State Machine</h2>
  <p>
    The following diagram shows the "typical" state machine diagram for resources following the Definition
    pattern.  Note that not all resources will support all states, some resources may choose different names
    for certain states and some resources may introduce sub-states to the listed states.  As well, additional
    transitions may be supported, including from terminal nodes (e.g. from "withdrawn" back to "active").
    That said, most resources should align with this state machine fairly well.
