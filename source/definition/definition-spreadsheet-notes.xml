  <h2>State Machine</h2>
  <p>
    The following diagram shows the "typical" state machine diagram for resources following the Definition
    pattern.  Note that not all resources will support all states, some resources may choose different names
    for certain states and some resources may introduce sub-states to the listed states.  As well, additional
    transitions may be supported, including from terminal nodes (e.g. from "withdrawn" back to "active").
    That said, most resources should align with this state machine fairly well.
