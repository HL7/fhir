<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
The Structured Data Capture (SDC) Initiative seeks to link clinical data, captured within the Electronic Health Record (EHR) 
system during clinical encounters, to supplemental systems that collect structured patient data within forms. For example, consider 
a clinician treating a patient who is participating in a clinical trial or comparative effectiveness research (CER). First, the 
clinician would select the applicable electronic case report form (eCRF) in the EMR.  Some information in the CRF would be 
automatically populated with current data derived from the EHR, and the remainder of the form's data would be entered in response 
to standardized questions posed by the eCRF.  The eCRF data will be captured in a structured form, and ultimately aggregated and 
transferred to end users as required for the particular use case.
</p>
<p>
SDC requires that the question/answer (data element) structure of EHR forms be specified in a standardized, interoperable and 
reproducible way.   As a consequence, SDC requires the definition of metadata for forms and data elements, in a manner relevant 
to EHRs and entities using EHR data. Therefore SDC aims to leverage synergistic government and health care industry efforts underway 
related to standards definition, and representation to facilitate capture, reporting, and analysis.  The standards and guidance 
incorporated into this implementation guide were based on the requirements defined in the 
<a href="http://wiki.siframework.org/Structured+Data+Capture+Use+Case">Structured Data Capture Initiative Standards and 
Interoperability Framework Use Case</a> document.  Users of this implementation guide will benefit greatly from review 
of the SDC Use Case document.
</p>
<h2>Initiative Overview</h2>

<p>
The Structured Data Capture (SDC) Initiative identifies and recommends standards for the interoperable representation and 
transmission of the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Standard form designs;</li>
  <li>Minimum data element attributes for the purpose of using them in form designs;</li>
  <li>Query for form;</li>
  <li>Return a form;</li>
  <li>Submit completed form data to an external data repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The use cases for SDC interaction specifications are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Retrieve data elements from a DE repository</li>
  <li>Retrieve a form from a form repository with or without pre-populated data</li>
  <li>Provide patient data (CCD or its FHIR equivalent) as part of the query to the form repository. The retrieved form should 
  be a fully/partially filled form instance</li>
  <li>Submit a completed form to an intended recipient</li>
</ul>
<p>
As applicable this implementation guide addresses data transmission security, limitation of access to appropriate personnel, 
data integrity, accountability, and adherence to suitable well-accepted informatics and networking standards.
</p>
<p>
The generic SDC workflow is pictured in Figure 1.

<p><i>
<u>Note</u>: The diagram depicts the optional storage of the completed form by the EHR. This can occur when the EHR stores a copy of 
the form as they send it to the External Data Repository or by the external data repository returning a copy of the form to 
the sender who can store in an internal version of the forms repository.

<p>
This implementation guide provides guidance on the use of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Profile(s) for SDC 
using the new DataElement resource and on the existing Questionnaire and QuestionnaireAnswers resources. The profiles in this 
implementation guide will be used to meet SDC project objectives of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>encouraging consistency around how common data elements are captured and used in healthcare systems</li>
  <li>allowing data elements to be clearly identified in forms for the purpose of auto-population and data-extraction</li>
  <li>allowing definition of standard data elements to improve consistency of data representation in CDA template and FHIR 
  resource design</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
This implementation guide provides implementers with guidance on how to achieve conformance with the standards recommended 
by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) Standards &amp; Interoperability Framework 
(S&amp;I), SDC Initiative.
</p>
<p>
The implementation guide will explain how the 3 resources (using the defined profiles) can be used to support auto-population 
of forms and data extraction.  As well, it will describe secure interaction specifications using Representational State 
Transfer (REST) services to allow access, display, populate and saving of the resources.
</p>
<p>
For this project, Data Element (DE) is defined as a named (identified) definition for a single piece of data (e.g. systolic 
blood pressure).
The new <a href="dataelement.html">DataElement</a> resource defines a common syntax based on ISO/IEC 11179-3 to allow unambiguous 
interpretation of DEs. The syntax is bound to controlled terminologies such as SNOMED CT, LOINC and RxNorm where appropriate.
</p>
<p>
The SDC profiles on the resources will identify the resource elements and extensions that must be supported to meet SDC use 
cases as well as constraints on their use.
</p>

<p>
<b>Out of scope for this implementation guide:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Defining DEs (semantics and their associated value sets)</li>
</ul>
