		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#999999; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px 4px 4px 4px;"><b><i>For an overview of this resource and others in the Medication Definition domain, also see the <a href="medication-definition-module.html">module page</a></i></b></p>
		<p>
			A material used in the preparation of a medicinal/pharmaceutical product, within the context of a particular use or role. 
		</p>
		<p>
			An ingredient is part of a product, either alone or in combination with other ingredients. 
			It is essentially a substance with the addition of the specific role it is playing in the product, or in preparation of the product
			which may include whether it is an active or inactive 
			substance and what the strength is (the quantity of substance compared to the whole product).
			The ingredient is represented in the context of a given product, because its role and strength are a function of what it is used in/for. 
			It is expected that the same substance used in a different role, or with a different strength, would be a different Ingredient resource instance.
			Resource instances may however be shared by very similar products (e.g. different pack sizes of the same "product").
		</p>
		<p>
			Some other resources, such as <a href="medication.html">Medication</a> and <a href="substance.html">Substance</a> 
			allow specifying a basic ingredient representation. When more detail is needed such as for manufacturing or regulatory use, 
			use the Ingredient resource.
