<p>
A <i>Diagnostic Order</i> is a record of a request for a set of diagnostic investigations to be performed. 
The investigation will lead to a <a href="diagnosticreport.htm">Diagnostic Report</a> that summarizes the 
outcome of the investigation, and includes any useful data and/or images that are relevant to the 
treatment/management of the subject.
</p>
<p>
The principal intention of the <i>Diagnostic Order</i> is to support ordering diagnostic investigations
on patients (which includes non-human patients in veterinary medicine). However in many contexts, 
healthcare related processes include performing diagnostic  investigations on groups of subjects, 
devices involved in the provision of healthcare, and even environmental locations such as ducts, 
bodies of water, etc. The <i>Diagnostic Order</i> supports all these usages.
</p>
<p>
The general work flow that this resource facilitates is that a clinical system creates a diagnostic
order. The diagnostic order is then exchanged, perhaps via intermediaries, with a system that 
represents a diagnostic service that can perform the investigation as a request to do so. 
The diagnostic service will update the request as the work is performed, and then finally
issue a report that references the requests that it fulfills.
</p>
<p>
Note that the Diagnostic Order itself is not a request to perform the 
investigation - it is just a record of the fact that a request was made. 
The Diagnostic Request must be paired with an <a href="order.htm">Order</a>
resource to convey the actual instruction, or part of an explicit messaging
or service workflow that carries the instruction.
