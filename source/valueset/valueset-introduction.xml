<p>There are three kinds of value sets:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>A value set that defines it's own codes as a <i>Code System</i></li>
 <li>A value set that is <i>composed</i> of codes from other code systems</li>
 <li>A value set that has been <i>expanded</i> into a single set of codes ready for use in a UI</li>
</ol>

<p>
A value set resource of kind "composition" is directly mappable to a CTS2 value set definition and an
automated transform should be possible in order to use a CTS2 server to provide 
value set functionality
