    <!-- we claim that this value set is a constraint on this other value set 
    this actual URL is a reference to a fictitious value set definition on a 
    fictitious FHIR value set registry. We claim here, simply for illustrative 
    purposes, that the value set referred to here is all LOINC codes for serum
    tests, and that this value set is therefor a constraint on that one
