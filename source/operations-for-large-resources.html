<h1>Operations for Large Resources (e.g., Groups/Lists)</h1>

<table class="colsi"><tr><td id="wg">Responsible Owner: <a _target="blank" href="[%wg fhir%]">[%wgt fhir%]</a> Work Group</td><td id="ballot"><a href="versions.html#std-process">Standards Status</a>:<!--!ns!--><a href="versions.html#std-process">Informative</a></td></tr></table>

<p>
HL7 is working on defining three new operations that make
it possible to add and remove items from the 
list or group, and to retrieve a focused subset of the 
information in the list and group without having to transmit 
the entire resource.
</p>
<p>
These operations are still under development, so they are presently found in the <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/api-incubator/operations-for-large-resources.html">API Incubator</a>.
