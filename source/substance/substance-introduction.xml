<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>

<p>
This is a base resource that represents raw materials used to represent a  packaged or measured amount of a known substance (e.g. bottle, jar, packet, drum) that is not in a consumable form nor associated directly with a patient.  For example, the materials used for a medication that are not yet in an administrable form. 
</p>  
<p>
The resource can be used to represent either a kind of a substance - e.g. a formulation commonly used for treating patients (a "definitional" use of Substance), 
or it can be used to describe a particular package of a known substance (an "instance" use of Substance).
</p>  
<p>
The composition of the material can be specified in terms of a mix of other materials, including with precise amounts if required.
</p>
<p>
A Substance may be identifiable as precise as the specific container it is stored in, while more commonly it would be based on a combination of lot number, quantity, and package type.

    the actual ingredients of a medication.
    This resource can represent an instance of a substance or a definition (type, kind) of one. See also the <a href="substancedefinition.html">SubstanceDefinition</a> resource, which is purely definitional.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="substancedefinition.html">SubstanceDefinition</a> describes the common characteristics of the substance, including those needed for regulatory agencies.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="nutritionproduct.html">NutritionProduct</a> distinguishes from a Substance in that a nutrition product is primary consumable purpose is for its nutritional effect.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="biologicallyderivedproduct.html">BiologicallyDerivedProduct</a> distinguishes from a Substance in that a BiologicallyDerivedProduct has its origins in a biological entity and needs to carry the sourceâ€™s characteristics to enable matching and compatibility with the biological target to which it will be transfused or implanted, as well as traceability to the source.
