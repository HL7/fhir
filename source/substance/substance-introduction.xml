<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>

<p>
This resource allows for a material to be represented. The resource can be used to represent either a kind of a 
substance - e.g. a formulation commonly used for treating patient (a "definitional" use of Substance), or it can be used to describe a particular package
of a known substance e.g. a bottle, jar or packet (an "instance" use of Substance).
</p>  
<p>
The composition of the material can be specified in terms of a mix of other materials, including with precise amounts if required.
