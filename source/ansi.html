FHIR Release 5 will not be submitted to <a href="https://www.ansi.org/">ANSI</a>
for consideration as a Normative standard. None of the new content in R5 
is considered Normative, and will be subject for futher review during the 
review and ballot process for Release 6. Note that content that was 
normative for Release 4 remains in effect normative, and will be treated 
accordingly during the R6 process.

HL7 is an <a href="https://www.ansi.org/">ANSI</a> Accredited Standards Development Organization. 
As such, ANSI reviews HL7 processes both in general, and also specifically with regard to each 
standard. ANSI has certified that portions of this release of FHIR (Release 4) met its 
requirements for development of a formal standard.

<p>
Given that many areas of the FHIR specification are still undergoing Trial Use by the HL7 
Community, and hence are not ready for balloting as a formal ANSI standard, and in order to 
manage the processes around the ballot process, four different portions of this specification
were balloted as ANSI Normative Specifications:
</p>
<table class="rows">
 <tr>
   <th><a href="ansi-infrastructure.html">Infrastructure</a></th>
   <td>The core framework on which FHIR solutions depend (Abstract base types, datatypes, formats, the RESTful API, and content and typing rules)</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <th><a href="ansi-conformance.html">Conformance</a></th>
   <td>The terminology infrastructure and the base resources that define FHIR implementations and that represent how the specification, and conformance to it, is defined</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <th><a href="ansi-patient.html">Patient</a></th>
   <td>The Patient resource and related content</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <th><a href="ansi-observation.html">Observation</a></th>
   <td>The Observation resource and related content</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
For the purposes of American National Standards, each of these is an independent standard, 
and the other parts of the specification do not contain requirements necessary for conformance 
to the formal standard. 
</p>
<p>
Given that the Normative parts of the standard are still a subset of what implementers 
need to use, implementers are generally focusing on conforming to FHIR R4 as a whole 
rather than the formal standards. Future versions of this specification will extend 
the coverage of format standards.
