<h2>Clinical Reasoning</h2>

<a name="intro"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Clinical Reasoning module provides resources and operations to enable the representation, distribution, and evaluation of clinical knowledge artifacts such as clinical decision support rules, quality measures, public health indicators, order sets, clinical protocols, and evidence summaries. In addition, the module describes how expression languages can be used throughout the specification to provide dynamic capabilities.</p>

<p>Clinical Reasoning involves the ability to represent and encode clinical knowledge in a very broad sense so that it can be integrated into clinical systems. This encoding may be as simple as controlling whether or not a particular section of an order set appears based on the conditions that a patient has, or it may be as complex as representing the care pathway for a patient with multiple conditions.</p>

<a name="scope"></a>
<h4>Scope</h4>
<p>The Clinical Reasoning module focuses on enabling two primary use cases:</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Sharing</b> - The ability to represent clinical knowledge artifacts such as decision support rules, order sets, clinical protocols, and quality measures, and to do so in a way that enables those artifacts to be shared across all organizations involved in care management and delivery.</li>
	<li><b>Evaluation</b> - The ability to evaluate clinical knowledge artifacts in the context of a specific patient or population, including the ability to request decision support guidance, impact clinical workflow, and retrospectively assess clinical quality metrics.</li>
</ol>

<p>To enable these use cases, the module defines several components that can each be used independently, or combined to enable more complex functionality. These components are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Expression Logic</b> - the representation of logic using languages such as <a href="http://hl7.org/fhirpath">FHIRPath</a> and <a href="http://cql.hl7.org">Clinical Quality Language (CQL)</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Definitional Resources</b> - resources that are not defined on any specific patient, but are used to define the actions to be performed as part of a clinical knowledge artifact such as an order set or decision support rule. These resources can be used directly, or with profiles to provide intended structure for specific types of resources.</li>
	<li><b>Knowledge Artifacts</b> - representation of clinical knowledge such as decision support rules, clinical quality measures, and evidence summaries.</li>
</ul>

<p>These basic components can then be used to enable a broad variety of clinical decision support and quality measurement use cases, including knowledge sharing, decision support services, and clinical quality assessment and reporting. The topics below provide more detailed discussion on each of these components and uses:</p>

<h3>Security and Privacy</h3>

<p>Because Knowledge Artifacts are typically patient-independent, many of the resources in the clinical reasoning module have no patient security and privacy concerns beyond the normal sensitivity that should be paid in any electronic healthcare system environment. However, the evaluation use case, including decision support guidance request/response, as well as quality measure evaluation have significant patient security and privacy concerns.</p>

<p>For the clinical decision support evaluation use case, as with any patient-specific information, care should be taken to ensure that the request and response are properly secured both at rest and in-motion, and that all access to the patient's information is done via a properly authenticated and authorized mechanism. This is particularly true of decision support artifacts where the logic is ingested as part of the definition of the artifact. In this scenario, the evaluation engine must ensure that data access within the ingested logic is subject to the same authentication and authorization requirements as any other access.</p>

<p>For guidance services that receive patient information, ensure that logging and auditing trails do not inadvertently compromise patient privacy and security by logging potentially sensitive information in an unencrypted way. In addition, guidance and recommendations returned from the service must ensure that content that contains patient information is clearly indicated so that consuming clients can take the appropriate care in integrating and displaying the resulting guidance.</p>

<p>For quality measure evaluation, individual and patient-list reports have the potential to contain large amounts of patient information. As with the decision support guidance responses, care must be taken to ensure the patient information is only accessible to properly authenticated and authorized agents, and that inadvertent breaches are minimized by following appropriate logging and auditing protocols.</p>

<p>In particular, because expression languages, depending on their power and scope, can provide the ability to access large amounts of data, as well as the potential for infinite recursion or looping, care should be taken to ensure that implementations adequately safeguard against Denial-of-Service-style attacks that leverage these capabilities to compromise systems by overloading capacity.</p>

<h3>Developmental Roadmap</h3>

<p>The resources defined for the Clinical Reasoning module are the result of the combined efforts of multiple communities working on the shared goal of harmonized standards and specifications for clinical decision support and quality measurement artifacts. The current state of the module reflects changes incorporated both from previous ballots on the FHIR-specific material, as well as content derived from several other balloted specifications in the CDS and CQM domains. The content at this point is capable of supporting the two primary use cases of sharing and evaluation in both domains and for a broad variety of artifacts.</p>

<p>In particular, the use of Clinical Quality Language (CQL) as a foundational mechanism for representing clinical quality logic enables decision support and quality measurement artifacts to share common definitions. For example, a Chlamydia Screening measure and related decision support artifacts focused on improving the measure can share a common library that describes the criteria for detecting when Chlamydia Screening is required in a patient. The decision support rule applies these criteria to determine when and how to impact a workflow, while the quality measure uses these same criteria to determine whether the screening goal has been met for a patient or population. In addition, the resources defined in this module use common patterns for describing the structure of artifacts and their associated metadata, enabling a consistent approach to the sharing and distribution of clinical knowledge artifacts.</p>

<p>Over the past year of trial use, the Clinical Reasoning module has been used in both the quality measurement and decision support domains to represent, exchange, and evaluate knowledge artifacts. This usage has generated feedback resulting in the addition of several new profiles, as well as guidance for using the Clincal Reasoning module with CDS Hooks and for quality reporting. Although this feedback resulted in some substantive changes, there were comparatively few, and the goals of the module for the next year are to push towards higher maturity levels and continue to seek implementation feedback.</p>

<p>The goals of the module over the next year are to provide a stable basis for implementation of the sharing use case, as well as unification with the CDS Hooks specification in support of the evaluation use case. The Clinical Quality Framework Initiative will use these resources as the basis for implementation projects, targeting an FMM level of 3 or 4 for all module resources within a year.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The FHIR Clinical Reasoning module is sponsored by the Clinical Decision Support (CDS) and Clinical Quality Information (CQI) HL7 Work Groups, with input and coordination from the FHIR Infrastructure and Service Oriented Architecture HL7 Work Groups.</p>

<p>The guidance in this module was prepared as a Universal Realm Specification with support from the <a href="https://oncprojectracking.healthit.gov/wiki/display/TechLabSC/CQF+Home">Clinical Quality Framework (CQF) initiative</a>, which was a public-private partnership sponsored by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) to identify, develop, and harmonize standards for clinical decision support and electronic clinical quality measurement. The <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CQIWC/Clinical+Quality+Framework">Clinical Quality Framework</a> effort transitioned to HL7's Clinical Quality Information (CQI) and Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Work Groups in 2016.</p>

<p>The Clinical Quality Framework is focused on harmonizing the historically disjointed specifications used by the Clinical Quality Measurement and Clinical Decision Support communities. Specifically, the initiative has focused on the specifications used to represent knowledge artifacts within the two communities. The strategy employed has been to break the conceptual content of knowledge artifacts into three core components, to define common standards for these core components, and to re-use these common standards for both clinical decision support and clinical quality measurement:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Metadata - Descriptive information about the artifact and its content</li>
	<li>Clinical Information - Information about a patient or population of concern within a given artifact</li>
	<li>Logic - The clinical reasoning involved in an artifact</li>
</ul>

<img alt="Clinical Quality Framework Conceptual Components" src="clinicalreasoning-components-diagram.jpg"/>

<p>The first component has resulted in the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=391">Clinical Quality Common Metadata Conceptual Model</a>, an informative document harmonizing metadata requirements between Quality Measurement and Decision Support artifacts.</p>

<p>The second component has resulted in the QUICK <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=378">Conceptual and Logical</a> Models, a harmonization of the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=338">Virtual Medical Record (vMR)</a> used in Decision Support and the <a href="https://ecqi.healthit.gov/qdm">Quality Data Model (QDM)</a> used in Quality Measurement, and with its core requirements realized in FHIR as the Quality Improvement Core (QICore) <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/index.html#contents">profiles</a>. Ongoing work in this area is focusing on coordination with the Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI) and a methodology for producing FHIR profiles from CIMI models. Currently, the QICore FHIR profiles (which are in turn derived from the US-Core profiles) can be used to model clinical quality data, and to present a consistent model for use in authoring and evaluating clinical quality artifacts.</p>

<p>Finally, the third component has resulted in the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=400">Clinical Quality Language specification</a>, a harmonization of the expressive capabilities of the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=337">Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact Specification (CDS KAS)</a> (produced by the <a href="http://healthedecisions.org">Health eDecisions</a> (HeD) Standards and Interoperability (S&amp;I) initiative), and the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=97">Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF)</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the ongoing CQF initiative pilot efforts, these developing specifications are being used to support knowledge artifact sharing, as well as evaluation of knowledge artifacts as part of decision support request/response and measure evaluation.</p>

<p>This module continues the harmonization of quality domain specifications by defining an approach to using a FHIR server as a component of a knowledge system in both the Knowledge Repository and Knowledge Evaluation Service roles.</p>
