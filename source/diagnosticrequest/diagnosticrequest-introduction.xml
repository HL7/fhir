		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
	    <p><strong>This resource is a <em>request</em> resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a>.</strong></p>
		<p>
A <i>Diagnostic Request</i> is a record of a request for a set of diagnostic investigations to be performed.
The investigation will lead to a <a href="diagnosticreport.html">Diagnostic Report</a> that summarizes the
outcome of the investigation, and includes any useful data and/or images that are relevant to the
treatment/management of the subject.
</p>
		<p>
The principal intention of the <i>Diagnostic Request</i> is to support ordering diagnostic investigations
on patients (which includes non-human patients in veterinary medicine). However in many contexts,
healthcare related processes include performing diagnostic  investigations on groups of subjects,
devices involved in the provision of healthcare, and even environmental locations such as ducts,
bodies of water, etc. The <i>Diagnostic Request</i> supports all these usages.
</p>
		<p>
The general work flow that this resource facilitates is that a clinical system creates a diagnostic
order. The diagnostic order is then exchanged, perhaps via intermediaries, with a system that
represents a diagnostic service that can perform the investigation as a request to do so.
The diagnostic service will update the request as the work is performed, and then finally
issue a report that references the requests that it fulfills.
</p>
<p>
The DiagnosticRequest resource allows requesting only a single investigation.
If a workflow requires requesting multiple items simultaneously, this is done using multiple instances of this resource.
These instances can be linked in different ways, depending on the needs of the workflow. For guidance, refer to <a href="request.html#compound">the Request pattern</a>

		<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
		<p>
DiagnosticRequest is closely related to other types of "request" resources, particularly <a href="referralrequest.html">ReferralRequest</a> and <a href="procedurerequest.html">ProcedureRequest</a>. In fact, for some services, it may be appropriate to use any one of these resources to request that the service be performed. Which one is used may be driven by organization practice and by context. When it is unclear which to use, the following principles may be helpful:
        </p>

<ul>
				<li>
ProcedureRequest or DiagnosticRequest are typically used when the requesting clinician has and wishes to exercise the authority (and expertise) to decide exactly what action will be done.
</li>
				<li>
A ReferralRequest is used when the requesting practitioner is seeking another practitioner or organization to use their own expertise and/or authority to determine the specific action to take.
</li>
				<li>
Whether an activity is deemed to be a procedure or only a diagnostic order is typically driven by how invasive the diagnostic process is. More invasive processes are typically represented as procedures, though the dividing line will vary by organization.
</li>
			</ul>
Irrespective of the guidance above, systems should be prepared for some degree of overlap between these resources and be prepared to execute searches against multiple resources in cases where differentiation cannot be guaranteed. As well, in some workflows more than one type of resource or even all three might exist; e.g. Upon receiving a ReferralRequest a practitioner might initiate a DiagnosticRequest. The diagnostic service might then initiate a ProcedureRequest.
		<p>
The DiagnosticRequest supports references to the numerous other resources that define information about the subject - the requester, associated encounter, <!--specimen, -->body site and other supporting information.   For example, <a href = "patient.html">Patient</a>, <a href = "practitioner.html">Practitioner</a><!--, <a href="specimen.html">Specimen</a>--> and <a href="condition.html">Condition</a> are all referenced in this resource.  Some systems may choose to bundle up a DiagnosticRequest and this referenced information into a Document for delivery to the recipient. However, REST, Messaging and Services are also valid architectures for managing referrals and may be more appropriate where active workflow management is needed.
</p>
		<p>
CarePlan typically references DiagnosticRequest with a stage of "plan" or "proposal", though the requests may have to be initiated and authorized outside of the CarePlan.  Similarly ClinicalImpression resource can reference DiagnosticRequest as part of a follow up to plan to the assessment.
