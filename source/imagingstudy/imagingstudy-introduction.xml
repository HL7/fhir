<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
ImagingStudy provides information on a DICOM imaging study, and the series and imaging objects in 
that study. It also provides information on how to retrieve that information (in a native DICOM 
format, or in a rendered format, such as JPEG). ImagingStudy is used to make available information 
about all parts of a single DICOM study. 
</p>
<p>
This resource provides mappings of its elements to DICOM attributes.  DICOM attributes are identified 
by a 32-bit tag, presented in canonical form as two four-digit hexadecimal values within parentheses 
and separated by a comma, e.g. (0008,103E).  The name and value representation (data type) of 
each attribute can be found 
in <a href="http://medical.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part06.html">DICOM Part 6 Data Dictionary</a>.  
The use of the attributes in the context of information objects, including detailed description of use, can be found 
in <a href="http://medical.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part03.html">DICOM Part 3 Information Object Definitions </a>.  
Attributes used in the DICOM query information models, such as "Number of Instances in Study", can be found 
in <a href="http://medical.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part04.html#chapter_C">DICOM Part 4 Annex C</a>.
</p>
<p>
ImagingStudy provides access to significant DICOM information but will only eliminate the need for DICOM 
query (e.g., QIDO-RS) in the simplest cases. The DICOM instances are not stored in the ImagingStudy 
resource; use of a DICOM WADO-RS server or other storage mechanism is needed.
</p>
<p> 
An ImagingStudy SHALL reference one DICOM Study, and MAY reference a subset of that Study. More than one ImagingStudy MAY reference the same DICOM Study or different subsets of the same DICOM Study.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p> 
ImagingStudy is used for DICOM imaging and associated information. Use <a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a> to 
track non-DICOM images, video, or audio. 
<a href="binary.html">Binary</a> can be used to store arbitrary content. 
<a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a> allow indexing and retrieval of clinical “documents” with relevant metadata.
