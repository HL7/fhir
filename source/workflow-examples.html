        <h3>Option F Scenario - Creation of Task on placer's system</h3>
        <p><b>Lab order to known performer</b></p>
        <p>A provider orders a serum glucose test for a patient to the local/regional lab.</p>
        <p>
          The local/regional lab has an established relationship with the medical clinic where the lab has a subscription that monitors for assigned lab orders.
          Prior to a patient's annual visit, their GP creates a lab requisition for a new serum glucose test to ensure they have current results to discuss at the
          patient's visit.  Their nurse assigns fulfillment of the requisition to the local lab, which receives a notification and accepts the lab order.  The patient
          visits a collection site and their blood is processed.  Upon completion, the Task is updated by the lab with a link to the DiagnosticReport and is marked
          as 'completed'.  The EHR retrieves the DiagnosticReport and associated Observations and presents them to the clinician for review prior to the patient's
          arrival for their visit.

        <h3>Option G Scenario - POST of Task to fulfiller's system</h3>
        <p><b>Outpatient prescription</b></p>
        <p>
            A patient is suffering from a poison ivy rash and is prescribed a steroid medication to manage the reaction. The provider asks the patient for his preferred pharmacy 
            and creates the Task at the specified pharmacy's system pointing to the MedicationRequest on the provider's system. The patient is running late
            and by the time he arrives at the pharmacy, it is closed. He calls the clinic where the provider practices and requests that the pharmacy where the order is 
            to be fulfilled is changed to one that is open around the clock. The staff at the
            clinic cancels the Task at the original pharmacy and creates a new Task at the requested new one. The new pharmacy updates the Task to accepted and 
            prepares the dispense.  By the time the patient arrives at the new pharmacy, the medication is ready for pickup. Once the medication is picked up is fulfilled, the clinic receives
            the notification that the Task is complete with a link to the MedicationDispense confirming the details of the dispensed medication and quantity.  At 
            some later point, when it is believed the patient has likely completed the use of the medication, the MedicationRequest is also marked as complete.

        <h3>Option H Scenario - POST of Task to a workflow broker</h3>
 
        <a name="optionI-ex1"> </a>
        <h3>Option I Scenario - POST of Task to fulfiller's system, followed by POST of sub-Task on placer's system</h3>
        <p><b>Outpatient referral</b></p>
        <p>
            A patient is seen by her Primary Care Provider (PCP) for shortness of breath and the provider decides to refer her to a cardiologist. Because of the referral, the provider's system creates ServiceRequest resource and POSTs a Task resource to a cardiologist's practice
            system, requesting a referral. This places the referral request on a referral coordinator's work list to review. Upon accepting the referral, the Task is updated as accepted and a new sub-Task, referencing both the ServiceRequest and the
            Task created by the provider's system, is created on the provider's system. The patient gets an appointment with the cardiologist and the sub-Task is updated with that information, allowing the provider's system to inform the provider of
            the change.
        </p>
        <p>
            The patient misplaces the information about the appointment and misses the visit with the cardiologist. The cardiologist's system updates the sub-Task to indicate the no-show and the PCP is alerted of the missed appointment. The provider's staff gets
            hold of the patient and schedules another appointment for her with the cardiologist. Because of the cardiologist's system scheduling the appointment, the sub-Task is updated with that information. The patient is seen and the sub-Task
            is updated accordingly. The cardiologist document the findings about the patient and updates the sub-Task as complete, adding references to the resources representing the findings. The PCP is alerted of the updates and marks the referral
            as complete, which updates the original Task and the ServiceRequest as complete as well.
