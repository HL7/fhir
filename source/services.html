<p>
Though FHIR resources are primarily designed for the <a href="http.html">RESTful HTTP-based implementation</a>, it is not
necessary to use a RESTful interface when exchanging the resources; one way that they can be exchanged is in the context of
services. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architecture pattern using services to encapsulate and provide discrete
pieces of application functionality to each other. Services communicate by invoking public interfaces and exchanging
information (as parameters and outputs) in accordance with a well-defined service contract.
</p>
<p>
Services are cohesive sets of functions that maintain responsibility for both data and "state" for the
scope of their responsibility.  Services have a unity of function, such as Terminology Management, Identity Management, or
so on, working with other services in collaboration as part of an orchestrated workflow.  Data within a service typically
follows a "black box" model and is not classically exposed, instead using pre-defined interfaces to make specific
behavioral requests for the service to fill.
</p>
<p>
To relate this to FHIR, resources in a service-oriented implementation can serve two discrete roles:  either as a payload
parameter, specifying information flowing into or out of a service; or in a behavioral sense, using FHIR APIs as the
invocation mechanism for engaging a service.  Service APIs are often realized using either RESTful or SOAP-based interfaces.
</p>
<p>
Of note, there are potential benefits in considering usage of FHIR and SOA together.  FHIR allows for ease of
implementation and ready access to data payload in an open way.  SOA has maturity around transactional integrity across
distributed systems instances, providing a framework for loose-coupling and addressing pre-conditions, exception handling,
and other implementation considerations of complex distributed systems.
</p>
<p>
This section illustrates different contexts to allow implementers to make informed decisions at implementation time,
considering potential impacts and solution patterns to benefit specific situations.  In doing so, this section will clarify
what is meant to apply SOA principles and specifications within a FHIR environment/implementation, and the converse.  It
will identify the situational factors to consider, and the elements of the SOA discipline that can be applied for more
effective FHIR implementation, providing a roadmap on how to optimize your implementation toolkit to make you and your team
most effective.
</p>
<p>
This section is being included as FHIR offers a highly flexible framework for interoperability that can be deployed that
can be used in a variety of different ways, and in ways that have the potential to hinder interoperability if not done
thoughtfully or consistently.  Use of SOA patterns and approaches can mitigate this risk, limiting the potential liability
resulting from the extreme flexibility of FHIR and fostering an overall framework that leads to deployment and consistency.
SOA provides guidance for how components interact, how to partition responsibilities, and how to manage workflows among
different parts of systems, all of which have potential utility in FHIR implementation settings.

<h3>Service References and Patterns</h3>
<p>
The definition of specific services is a domain or context specific task. It is anticipated that this
would be done as separate specifications that make use of the underlying facilities defined in this specification.  HL7 has
already defined a portfolio of services that take advantage of REST- and SOAP-based interfaces, but the parameters passed
to and from those services are not at present resource-based.  These are potential extension points that may lend well for
FHIR implementation.  Services defined like this are able to build on the common underlying platform features defined in
this specification such as REST or messaging, and add specific interactions where appropriate. Alternatively, the service
interfaces can build an entirely separate implementation.
</p>
<p>
Note that for each of the items below, there are paired sets of standards, an HL7 Standard defining the functional
specification, and an OMG Technical Standard containing SOAP bindings (for all the items below) and REST bindings (for
about half of the items below).
</p>
<p>
The portfolio of healthcare SOA service specifications includes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>IXS (Identification and Cross-Reference Services) that identifies the characteristic of a generic identification management services  (<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/IXS">www.omg.org/spec/IXS</a>)</li>
 <li>RLUS (Retrieve, Locate, Update Service) that supports the generic management resource in a SOA environment.   (<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/RLUS">www.omg.org/spec/RLUS</a>)</li>
 <li>ServD (Service directory) that supports the registration and discovery of health and human-related services  (<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/ServD">www.omg.org/spec/ServD</a>)</li>
 <li>CDSS (Clinical Decision Support Service) that defines a standard access interface to a clinical decision support system (<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/CDSS">www.omg.org/spec/CDSS</a>)</li>
 <li>CTS2 (Common Terminology Service V 2) that defines the capabilities, responsibilities, inputs, outputs, and expected behavior to support the management, maintenance, and interaction with ontologies and medical vocabulary systems (<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/CTS2">www.omg.org/spec/CTS2</a>)</li>
 <li>CCS (Care Coordination Service) that provides the capabilities to support the coordination of patient care across the care continuum spanning multiple organization [emerging specification]</li>
 <li>OS (Order Service) that provides functional capabilities for ordering pharmacy, laboratory, radiology, consult and nutritional services individually or part of an order set [emerging specification].</li>
 <li>EPSS (Event Publication &amp; Subscription Service) that provides a Service Functional Model (SFM) for services, components and systems to subscribe to clinical events of interest and receive notice when new data are available [emerging specification].</li>
 <li>UCS (Unified Communications Service) facilitates the bi-directional communication between participants (both SOA services and human participants) that is so essential for the efficient delivery and coordination of patient care [emerging specification].</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note:   FHIR-enablement of the services above is already occurring on a limited basis.  The <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2015Sep/cqif/cqif.html">Clinical Quality Improvement Framework</a>  (CQIF) portion of the FHIR specification
is an example of a technical interface and resources that have been influenced by prior SOA work.
Similarly, this specification defines a <a href="terminology-service.html">Terminology Service</a> which
is tightly integrated with the RESTful API (note: this terminology service has different goals than
the CTS2 service, so they are not functionally equivalent). FHIR itself is a framework for the instantiation
of an RLUS service. Definition of other additional services based on the service interface definitions
provided by the HL7 SOA work group will be considered if there is enough interest in this.
</p>

<a name="approaches"></a>
<h3>Implementation Approaches</h3>
<p>
Given that there are a set of available services that can be applied directly or used as a pattern in conjunction with FHIR,
it merits consideration that there are alternative ways to bring together FHIR and SOA, each of which has benefits and
drawbacks.  Three specific styles of implementation have been identified:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>FHIR + REST ("RESTful FHIR"), the predominant approach for implementing FHIR today</li>
 <li>FHIR + WS* represents FHIR implementations using the web services stack as the communication protocol instead of REST. This would include use of FHIR resources as payload parameters in SOAP calls, for example</li>
 <li>FHIR + SOA Pattern illustrates the impact of applying interaction patterns, exception handing and role definition, guided by SOA practices, atop an implementation technology (SOAP, REST, or others)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Determining which of the above implementation styles is best suited to a situation is context-dependent.  The
following table presents these alternatives, deliberately using qualitative measures to help navigate to the best-fit based
upon influencing factors.  "Harvey Balls" in the table below indicate relative strengths and weaknesses of the
implementation alternatives.

<h3>Architectural Considerations </h3>
<p>
FHIR resources are designed to be used in a wide variety of contexts. In particular, FHIR resources are required to be
suitable for use in a REST environment. This means that there are number of design requirements and choices that impact
how suitable resources are for use with services.
</p>
<p>
If service use was the only consideration, different decisions would be made, and resources would be more suitable for use
with services. However, this would curtail their usefulness and reusability in other contexts.
</p>
<p>
<b>API/Interface Design</b>.  Services' API design is explicit and exposes service capabilities which are a part of a service
contract to consuming applications.  This contrasts with what is the default interface into a FHIR server of a REST-based
interface exposing CRUD operations and stateless access. Good SOA design practice indicates loosely-coupled access (e.g.,
external clients do not have visibility into the inner workings of a service) improves implementation flexibility over time,
permitting design and performance improvements with the maturation of the implementation.  As such, interfaces are
typically exposed and aligned with business functionality (such as "Register Patient" or "Validate Identity").
</p>
<p>
Bridging what is not necessarily a natural-fit between SOA operations and RESTful operations are key to interface design.
Implementers may elect to apply finer grained FHIR interactions to be encapsulated in coarse-grained functions, delegating
those responsibilities to either implementations within a FHIR instance or to external code not visible to the service
consumer.
</p>
<p>
Principal within the design objective is to minimize or eliminate responsibilities on behalf of the service consumer to
understand or apply knowledge of the service implementation.  This frees up the service provider to be able to evolve and
improve the inner workings of the service without a "ripple effect" adversely impacting service consumers.  In doing so,
technical dependencies are minimized.   Several good sources of SOA Design Patterns are available from HL7 and other public
sources.
</p>
<p>
<b>Data Storage and Coherence</b>.  The approach to and complexities associated with data storage and overall data coherence will
significantly depend upon whether an implementation is subject to enterprise policies and whether data consistency is the
responsibility of the service provider or consumer.  In Enterprise settings, these issues are typically governed by
organizational policy. FHIR servers and their data persistence would need to fit within that policy, with data access following
that policy and services interacting with "policy enforcement points" to assure that appropriate
permissions are in place.
</p>
<p>
Where data consistency is the responsibility of the service (or server) use of SOA-friendly interface protocols, such as
SOAP and potentially REST, create the access channel for integration.  This may necessitate defining minimum sets of data
that are required to comply with data coherence expectations (in other words, a service contract that specifies the
collection of resources that must be updated in tandem, and the scope of what constitutes a 'single transaction' - more on
this in the Transactional Integrity section).
</p>
<p>
In alternative implementations data storage is managed within the FHIR server, consistent with non-SOA FHIR implementations.
Data consistency is the responsibility of the Server, but responsibility may carry to consuming applications (if they are
provided with sufficient update rights so as to make that a concern).  Data validation also has a shared responsibility,
first with the FHIR Server, and additionally with the authorized updating applications. Data visibility is a product of the
REST interface, typically allowing CRUD operations to the data element level.
</p>
<p>
<b>Transactional Integrity</b>.  When encapsulating functionality within a SOA-type service, data and transactional integrity are
essential in making sure that data received and stored is accurate and consistent with what was received.  An issue
particularly with update functions, the ability to update multiple different resources and maintain harmony among them as
part of a broader transaction is how this is typically realized.
</p>
<p>
Should one part of the update 'fail', one would expect all the other updates to be "rolled back" to a prior, stable state.
Rollback is not expressly specified as part of the FHIR.  Data update and integrity becomes the responsibility of each
service.  The FHIR specification does not inherently provide for concurrency management (e.g., managing of "deadlock"
conditions where two resources each await update permission from the other). As a result, within the FHIR server itself it
is assumed that fault tolerance and server availability is being managed (beyond the scope of the specification).
</p>
<p>
Applied use of SOA patterns have benefits in terms of distributed transactional integrity, as SOA has substantially removed
burdens from calling (client) applications, instead levying these responsibilities upon the service provider.  This has
relevance because it is customary in larger scale implementations (such as large enterprises) that service consumers are
varied and not necessarily know in advance to the service.  As a result, these implementation patterns make for more robust
infrastructure, mitigating potential implementation risk and ultimately improving data quality.   We note that these
elements can be manually accommodated in FHIR implementations, absent use of SOA patterns, though that can lead to
inconsistent interpretation, delegated responsibility to client application(s), and the potential for incompatible
implementations.
</p>
<p>
<b>Modularity</b>.  The modularity of resources - which resources are defined, and why - is driven by a wide set of considerations
around how they are used. Resources are a platform on which a set of business/clinical services of various kinds are
provided. Accordingly, the resources are defined for general use, and they can be expected to be less suitable for a
particular service than custom defined structures. The pay back is wider re-use of the information that the service deals
with.
</p>
<p>
Effective "service-orientation" establishes modularity at both a macro and micro-level.  At the macro-level, services
themselves are modular, componentized, and composable.  Since each service has a singularity of purpose with a well-defined
interface, they are naturally suited to working in tandem with other services and consistent with modular design.  At a
more fine-grained level, the interfaces into and out of services also allow for modularity, and the ability to leverage the
structure of FHIR resources as a payload descriptor for carrying data structures and corresponding semantics across APIs is
modularly based.
</p>
<p>
<b>Explicit State</b>.  All resources represent the various states of the record and real-world entities involved in a transaction
explicitly. This is necessary for use in RESTful and document contexts, where there is no explicit transaction. Service
interactions are typically associated with implicit semantics, such as a request to change the status of a resource to
something else, for example. The fact that resources that carry this state explicitly as well as the transaction fixing
state implicitly creates duplication between the two, and this will need to be managed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Error Handling</b>.  SOA provides an implementation approach providing consistency in error handling, escalation, and error
management. These tools can be leveraged to identify likely error conditions and exceptions based upon prior SOA work,
helping to put into place infrastructure within FHIR to manage those exceptions. Moreover, this alignment creates future
opportunity to more effectively integrate FHIR resources into an enterprise SOA fabric should that become a need.  It is
not anticipated that there is a need to change error management for FHIR, except to address payload-specific errors that
may arise.
</p>
<p>
The FHIR specification does not specifically address error handling between and across servers and clients. When
implementing within larger or more complex environments, particularly in situations where multiple FHIR servers may be
involved (especially if they are provided by different vendors/implementations), error handing and management can quickly
become complex and untenable.
</p>
<p>
<b>Resource References</b>.  The most obvious impact is that resources <a href="references.html">refer to each other using full URL based references</a>, and
there are a number of rules around how these references are resolved. In the context of a service, this means that the
references between modules carry this extra weight of choice and obligation, even when it might not be necessary.
</p>
<p>
FHIR <a href="resourcelist.html">resources</a> or <a href="bundle.html">bundles</a> may be used as the parameters or outputs of service interfaces.
</p>

<a name="other"></a>
<h3>Other Considerations </h3>
<p>
<b>Orchestration</b>.  <i>Orchestration</i> is a term typically used within SOA to describe the steps, sequencing, and dynamic adjustment
of workflow to meet a process need. Orchestrations may be entirely automated and fulfilled in a short timeline, or longer
and multistep in fulfillment of a business process that may involve manual steps and human intervention. In the context of
FHIR implementation, orchestration would refer to the sequencing of collections of FHIR (or service) calls that are used in
tandem to fulfil a specific need.
</p>
<p>
Orchestration is neither natively supported nor unsupported in FHIR, save the availability of the FHIR Batch mode which
allows for some degree of compounding of operations. In a SOA environment, orchestration is typically realized by
documenting in some formalism, such as Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), a sequence of steps and flows, and
inherent logic or decision-points affecting that flow. An engine is then capable of executing the process flow, receiving
inputs during execution to adjust or adapt those processes based upon situational need as part of delivery fulfillment.
</p>
<p>
There are many examples where this approach is advantageous. For example, in a Care Management situation, test results,
current problems, chief complaint, and potentially even resource availability might affect subsequent steps in fulfilling a
care plan. Based upon changes to any of these factors, the sequence of calls and ultimately the systems or FHIR servers
involved would vary. The role of automated clinical decision support is another example that naturally ties to workflow
orchestration, adjusting care pathways based upon patient evaluation and affecting process flows within a health system.
</p>
<p>
At present, to support this complexity within a FHIR setting without the use of SOA tools, these flows would need to be
manually coded, either by having a directed sequence of calls, or by creating an independent capability effectively acting
as an orchestrator. This can be supported within FHIR exclusively, but all the steps and corresponding state management
would need to be done by hand. FHIR Batch provides some of this capability, allowing for aggregation of multiple steps, but
does not necessarily support the event processing needed in complex.
</p>
<p>
<b>Security</b>.  Security is inherently a dimension of any enterprise SOA architecture, meaning that the responsibility within a
service implementation is to provide the "hooks" to interact with that architecture. In other words, the service does not
need to create or enforce security, it needs to interact with those enterprise components that have that responsibility.
This includes topics such as identity management, access control, or other dimensions of a secure solution.  SOA guidance
can foster an effective design involving FHIR in support of authentication, policy enforcement, role-based access controls,
and a host of other provisions and protections. It is important to note that within SOA, security is an established,
mainstream, and mature offering. Reuse of these concepts can help prevent inadequate, incomplete, or ineffective security
measures within FHIR, and eliminate the need to re-invent solutions exclusively for FHIR.
</p>
<p>
Enterprises typically have security architecture into which a SOA environment will have already integrated. Service
implementations would rely upon this existing infrastructure as part of authentication, access control, etc. Policy
enforcement is a function of the architecture and not a specific service itself. Services would rely upon policy
enforcement points to govern access to information.
</p>
<p>
While technical dimensions of security would be addressed by the security architecture directly, FHIR implementers should
anticipate that data-specific access control policies would need to be captured and formalized so that they are enforceable
within the architecture. For example, if a new service is handling protected health information, the policy enforcement
point within the architecture would need to know that the service has that nature of data.
</p>
<p>
<b>Resource Identity</b>.  All resources have a single identity (the full URL), and a logical id which may be maintained as the
resource moves from server to server (see <a href="managing.html">Managing Resource Identity</a> for further discussion). Since this identity is used
by any reference to the resource, it must be maintained when the resource is exchanged so that references from other
resources to the one being exchanged can still be resolved. Any use of resources in a service environment needs to address
how these references can be resolved. This can be achieved by delegating the reference resolution to a RESTful framework,
by ensuring that all the relevant resources are contained in the service call, or by making some service-based arrangement
by which additional resources can be retrieved.   Services that exchange resources SHOULD maintain resource identity.
Further, as explicit version tracking is not a guaranteed capability of a service call, services that exchange resources
should include version information associated with resources being exchanged.
</p>
<p>
<b>Capability Statement</b>.  When using <a href="http.html">RESTful exchange</a>, <a href="messaging.html">messaging</a>, and <a href="documents.html">document</a> based exchange, the Capability statement
allows authoring and reading applications to describe how they use a resource. The <a href="capabilitystatement.html">Capability Statement</a> supports trading
partner negotiation from specification time through to run-time discovery. The Capability statement doesn't provide any
equivalent way to make declarations about services, though this might be added in the future if common requirements emerge.
Services are expected to make appropriate arrangements around discovery and compatibility, though it is expected that these
will vary considerably.
</p>
<p>
Services that exchange resources MAY choose to provide support for describing and changing descriptions of service
implementations.
</p>

<a name="rationale"></a>
<h3>Relating SOA and FHIR:  Rationale </h3>
<p>
At its core, FHIR is based upon the elemental capabilities of Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD), allowing access to
resources where interaction is primarily based upon these operations. Of note, multi-step or complex processing levies
requirements upon the calling, client application.   Sequencing of events, particularly when those events involve
orchestration of complex or dynamic processes, can benefit from the application of SOA techniques and patterns. This is
common where multi-step processing is involved, and particularly important when adjustments to a process flow can be made
based upon situational context.
</p>
<p>
As these areas are both commonplace within health settings and not inherent strengths of FHIR, the marriage of FHIR and SOA
techniques provides a viable and beneficial path forward to improving implementation and mitigating risks by leveraging
proven and established industry best-practices.
</p>
<p>
SOA design patterns are frequently used to govern interactions for dynamic processes, non-sequential workflows, or dynamic
workflows involving human intervention and/or consideration of external factors as part of processing. The ability to model
interaction patterns using languages such as SOAml, and to define roles and role interactions, are tools that may be useful
to FHIR development in these circumstances - and would be indicators signaling that SOA has the potential to add value to a
FHIR implementation.
</p>
<p>
SOA design principles can provide guidance to a FHIR implementer resulting in reduction of co-dependencies between
components, promoting "loose coupling" and minimizing potential impacts resulting from changes to inner workings of one
component adversely affecting others. (For those familiar with the term, this encourages "black box" implementation).
</p>
<p>
SOA provides guidance around data persistence, durability, and expectations in support of the data lifecycle.
</p>

<a name="summary"></a>
<h3>Summary </h3>
<p>
FHIR has proven itself as beneficial in that it provides an easy-to-implement and coherent approach to accessing healthcare
resources using a modern protocol stack. SOA has proven itself over time in multiple vertical market segments to
divide responsibilities and authoritatively manage information across distributed systems. Marrying the discipline of SOA
with the implementation ease of FHIR is a winning combination when the situation warrants.  Implementers should consider
evaluation of the contextual landscape to determine where FHIR and SOA can benefit from complementary
implementation leverage points.
</p>
<p>
Recognizing that there are situations where the coming-together of FHIR implementation and SOA techniques are advantageous,
there are several implementation approaches available. Note that the selection of which approach is advantageous for any
given situation will depend upon a variety of factors: existing legacy implementation and available APIs (particularly for
interfacing applications), the strategic direction/IT roadmap of the organization, and so on.  Noting that there are
different styles of realizing FHIR and SOA together, a recap of the principal alternatives would include:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  "Full Support in FHIR" Approach. This alternative involves simplification of the exposed behaviors of the
  service/server so as to be supported within the REST protocol, thus allowing full support within FHIR.
  Behind a FHIR technology stack, SOA design principles such as loose coupling and "black box" API design
  would be coded to create service autonomy.
 </li>
 <li>
  "Classic SOA with FHIR Payload" Approach. This alternative is attractive particularly in enterprises that
  have or are making investments in SOA infrastructure. This alternative relies upon traditional SOA service
  definition, leveraging use of FHIR Resources as the parameters into and out of the service.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
It is important to note that electing to apply SOA patterns to FHIR implementation does not fundamentally change the
nature of what is being implemented. Applied correctly, it results in minor adaptation to coding and interface design
resulting in enhanced consistency across implementations as well as enhanced interoperability and robustness.

<b>SOA in a FHIR Environment</b> considers the benefits of applying SOA patterns and best-practices to a FHIR implementation
community. In these cases, developers are faced with implementation decisions that have the potential to benefit from
existing case studies, design patterns, or guidance that may either help provide consistency among FHIR implementations, or
which may address gaps - either known or unidentified - resulting from implicit assumptions around a FHIR implementation.
</p>
<p>
<b>FHIR in a SOA Environment</b> considers the implications of using FHIR in a large, established enterprise that has or is making
investments in SOA infrastructure. In these cases, shared services, enterprise policies, and existing infrastructure is
common, and FHIR implementations would need to fit within the fabric of that environment.
</p>
<p>
Finally, it merits mention that not every FHIR implementation benefits from SOA, and vice-versa. The goal of this section is
to help implementers navigate based upon their specific considerations to help determine if and to what extent these
approaches provide benefits.
