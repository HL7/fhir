<h2>Notes:</h2>
<h3>Enteral continuous vs. intermittent tube feedings</h3>
<p>Tube feedings can be administered via continuous drip using a pump or via intermittent feedings, using gravity drip or a pump.  The examples <a href="nutritionorder-example-enteralbolus.html">Nutrition Order Enteral Bolus Feeding Example</a> and <a href="nutritionorder-example-enteralcontinuous.html">Nutrition Order Enteral Continuous Feeding Example</a> show how this resource can be used to order both kinds of enteral feeding using the structured data elements.   The continuous feeding typically specifies rate of administration and a maximum volume of delivery using the enteralFormula.administration.rate and enteralFormula.maxVolumeToDeliver elements. On the other hand, the intermittent feeding typically specifies the amount and frequency of administration using the enteralFormula.administration.quantity and enteralFormula.schedule elements.  In both cases, to vary the rate or quantity over time the enteralFormula.administration element can be repeated.

<h3>Note about the examples</h3>
<p>
The examples associated with this resource demonstrate the core elements and do not necessarily reflect real-world implementations that may be constrained by future profiles for a given implementation or setting.  For example, a renal diet is often comprised of pre-coordinated components including common nutrient modifications such as protein, potassium and phosphorus to assist with the speed of entry of complex diet orders.
