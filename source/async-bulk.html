  <h3 id="use-case">Use Case</h3>
  <p>All of the interactions defined in the <a href="http.html">RESTful API</a> are described as synchronous operations
    - that is, the client makes a query and waits for the server to respond with the outcome in the HTTP response. This
    pattern is not always suitable when substantial amounts of data must be returned.</p>
  <p>A good example of this is the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/export.html">$export operation</a>, where
    simple searches may result in large amounts of data. </p>
  <p>The asynchronous request pattern, based on <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7240#section-4.1">rfc 7240</a>,
    caters to this use case and is applicable for for use in <a href="operations.html">Operations</a> and
    <a href="http.html">Defined Interactions</a> interactions. Servers may choose which interactions the pattern should be
    supported
    on (if at all).</p>

  <h4 id="compare-with">Related Pattern: Asynchronous Interaction Request</h4>
  <p>For use cases that return small amounts of data but may take a lot of time to process, see <a href="async-bundle.html">Asynchronous Interaction Request</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="kick-off-request">Kick-off Request</h3>
  <p>The request will support the HTTP methods, URLs, headers and other parameters that normally apply, but servers
    SHALL also support the <code>Prefer</code> header described below, and SHOULD support the <code>Accept</code> header
    and <code>_outputFormat</code> parameter described below.</p>

  <h5 id="headers">Headers</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><code>Accept</code> (string)</p>
      <p>Specifies the format of the optional <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a> response to
        the kick-off request. A client SHOULD provide this header. A server may support any subset of the <a
          href="resource-formats.html#wire">Serialization Format Representations</a>. If omitted, the server MAY return an error
        or MAY process the request and return a format selected by the server.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><code>Prefer</code> (string, required)</p>
      <p>Specifies whether the response is immediate or asynchronous. Setting this to <code>respond-async</code>
        triggers this async pattern.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 id="kick-off-parameters">Parameters</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><code>_outputFormat</code> (string, optional, defaults to <code>application/fhir+ndjson</code>)</p>
      <p>The format for the generated bulk data files. Currently, <a href="http://ndjson.org/">ndjson</a> must be
        supported, though servers may choose to also support other output formats. Servers SHALL support the full
        content type of <code>application/fhir+ndjson</code> as well as abbreviated representations including
        <code>application/ndjson</code> and <code>ndjson</code>.
      </p>
      <p>For requests types where the server supports either the Asynchronous Bulk Data Request pattern or the <a
          href="async-bundle.html">Asynchronous Interaction Request</a> pattern,
        requests that include the <code>_outputFormat</code> parameter SHALL trigger the Asynchronous Bulk Data Request pattern.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 id="kick-off-response---success">Response - Success</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP Status Code of <code>202 Accepted</code> </li>
    <li><code>Content-Location</code> header with the absolute URL of an endpoint for subsequent status requests
      (polling location)</li>
    <li>Optionally, a <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a> in the body</li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="kick-off-response---error">Response - Error (e.g. unsupported search parameter)</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP Status Code of <code>4XX</code> or <code>5XX</code></li>
    <li>The body SHALL be a <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a></li>
  </ul>
  <hr />

  <h3 id="delete-request">Delete Request</h3>

  <p>After a Bulk Data request has been started, a client MAY send a http DELETE request to the URL provided in the
  <code>Content-Location</code> header to cancel the request. If the request has been completed, a server MAY use the
  request as a signal that a client is done retrieving files and that it is safe for the sever to remove those from
  storage. Following the delete request, when subsequent requests are made to the polling location, the server SHALL
  return a <code>404 Not Found</code> error and an associated <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome
    Resource</a>.</p>

  <h5 id="delete-response---success">Response - Success</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP Status Code of <code>202 Accepted</code></li>
    <li>Optionally a FHIR OperationOutcome in the body</li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="delete-response---error">Response - Error</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP status code of <code>4XX</code> or <code>5XX</code></li>
    <li>Optionally a <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a> in the body</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="status-request">Status Request</h3>

  <p>After a Bulk Data request has been started, the client MAY poll the status URL provided in the
    <code>Content-Location</code> header by issuing HTTP GET requests to the location.
  </p>

  <p>A client SHOULD follow an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff">exponential backoff</a>
    approach when polling for status. A server SHOULD supply a <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After"><code>Retry-After</code></a> header
    with a with a delay time in seconds (e.g., <code>120</code> to represent two minutes) or a http-date (e.g.,
    <code>Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT</code>). When provided, a client SHOULD use this information to inform the
    timing of future polling requests. The server SHOULD keep an accounting of status queries received from a given
    client, and if a client is polling too frequently, the server SHOULD respond with a
    <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> status code in addition to a <code>Retry-After</code> header, and optionally a <a
      href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a> with further explanation. If excessively frequent
    status queries persist, the server MAY return a <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> status code and terminate the
    session. Other standard HTTP <code>4XX</code> as well as <code>5XX</code> status codes may be used to identify
    errors as mentioned.
  </p>

  <p>When requesting status, the client SHOULD use an <code>Accept</code> header indicating a content type of
    <code>application/json</code>. In the case that errors prevent the asynchronous operation from completing, the server SHOULD respond
    with a <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a> in JSON format.
  </p>

  <h5 id="status-response---in-progress">Response - In-Progress</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP Status Code of <code>202 Accepted</code></li>
    <li>Optionally an <code>X-Progress</code> header with a text description of the status of the request that is less
      than 100 characters. The format of this description is at the server's discretion and MAY be a percentage complete
      value, or MAY be a more general status such as "in progress". The client MAY parse the description, display it to
      the user, or log it.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="status-response---error">Response - Error</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP status code of <code>4XX</code> or <code>5XX</code></li>
    <li><code>Content-Type</code> header of <code>application/fhir+json</code> when body is a <a
        href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a></li>
    <li>The body of the response SHOULD be a <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a> in
      JSON format. If this is not possible (for example, the infrastructure layer returning the error is not FHIR
      aware), the server MAY return an error message in another format and include a corresponding value for the
      <code>Content-Type</code> header.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the case of a polling failure that does not indicate failure of the original request, a server SHOULD use a <a
      href="codesystem-issue-type.html#issue-type-transient">transient code</a> from the <a
      href="codesystem-issue-type.html">IssueType valueset</a> when populating the <a
      href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome Resource</a> <code>issue.code</code> element to indicate to the
    client that it should retry the request at a later time.</p>

  <p><em>Note</em>: Even if some of the requested resources cannot successfully be returned, the overall request MAY
    still succeed. In this case, the <code>Response.error</code> array of the completion response body SHALL be
    populated with one or more files in ndjson format containing <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome
      Resources</a> to indicate what went wrong (see below). In the case of a partial success, the server SHALL use a
    <code>200</code> status code instead of <code>4XX</code> or <code>5XX</code>. The choice of when to determine that
    an job has failed in its entirety (error status) vs. returning a partial success (complete status) is left up to the
    server implementer.
  </p>

  <h5 id="status-response---complete">Response - Complete</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP status of <code>200 OK</code></li>
    <li><code>Content-Type</code> header of <code>application/json</code></li>
    <li>The server SHOULD return an <code>Expires</code> header indicating when the files listed will no longer be
      available for access.</li>
    <li>A body containing a JSON object providing metadata, and links to the generated Bulk Data files. The files SHALL
      be accessible to the client at the URLs advertised. These URLs MAY be served by file servers other than a
      FHIR-specific server.</li>
  </ul>

          <br />
          <br />
          Each file item SHALL contain the following fields:
          <br />
          <br />
          - <code>type</code> - the FHIR resource type that is contained in the file.
          <br />

          Each file SHALL contain resources of only one type, but a server MAY create more than one file for each
          resource type returned. The number of resources contained in a file MAY vary between servers. If no data are
          found for a resource, the server SHOULD NOT return an output item for that resource in the response. These
          rules apply only to top-level resources within the response; as always in FHIR, any resource MAY have a
          "contained" array that includes referenced resources of other types.
          <br />

          Each file item MAY optionally contain the following field:
          <br />

          <br />
          <br />
          The ability to convey deleted resources is important in cases when a server may have previously returned data
          and wishes to indicate that these data should be removed from downstream systems. When a
          timestamp parameter such as <code>_since</code> is supported by the request type and supplied in the kick-off
          request, this array SHOULD be populated with output files containing
          FHIR Transaction Bundles that indicate which FHIR resources match the kick-off request criteria, but have been
          deleted subsequent to the timestamp. If no resources have been deleted, or the
          timestamp parameter was not supplied, or the server has other reasons to avoid exposing these data,
          the server MAY omit this key or MAY return an empty array. Resources that appear in the 'deleted' section of
          a manifest SHALL NOT appear in the 'output' section of the manifest.
          <br />
          <br />
          Each line in the output file SHALL contain a FHIR Bundle with a type of <code>transaction</code> which SHALL
          contain one or more entry items that reflect a deleted resource. In each entry, the <code>request.url</code>
          and <code>request.method</code> elements SHALL be populated. The <code>request.method</code> element SHALL be

  <h3 id="output-file-request">Output File Request</h3>

  <p>Using the URLs supplied by the FHIR server in the Complete Status response body, a client MAY download the
    generated Bulk Data files (one or more per resource type) within the time period specified in the
    <code>Expires</code> header (if present). If the <code>requiresAccessToken</code> field in the Complete Status body
    is set to <code>true</code>, the request SHALL include a valid access token.
  </p>

  <p>As long as servers are following relevant security guidance, they MAY choose to generate output manifests where
    <code>requiresAccessToken</code> is true or false; this applies even for servers available on the public internet.
    When <code>requiresAccessToken</code> is set to <code>false</code> and no additional authorization-related
    extensions are present on the completion manifest's output entry, then the output URLs SHALL be dereferenceable
    directly, and SHALL be short lived following the expiration timing requirement that have been documented for bearer
    tokens in the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/authorization/index.html">SMART Backend Services
      Authorization Guide</a>. In this case, a client MAY re-fetch the output manifest if output links have expired and
    MAY use the Expires header on the output response, when present, as a hint to know when capability URLs will expire.
  </p>

  <p>The output data SHALL include only the most recent version of any FHIR resources unless the client explicitly
    requests different behavior in a fashion supported by the server (e.g., via a new query parameter yet to be
    defined). Inclusion of the <code>Resource.meta</code> information in the resources is at the discretion of the
    server (as it is for all FHIR interactions).</p>

  <p>References in the resources returned MAY be relative URLs with the format
    <code>resourceType</code>/<code>id</code>, or MAY be absolute
    URLs with the same structure rooted in the base URL for the server from which the asynchronous operation was performed.
  </p>

  <p>Example NDJSON output file:</p>
  <pre><code class="json language-json">{"resourceType":"Patient","id":"5c41cecf-cf81-434f-9da7-e24e5a99dbc2","name":[{"given":["Brenda"],"family":["Jackson"]}],"gender":"female","birthDate":"1956-10-14T00:00:00.000Z"}

  <h5 id="attachments">Attachments</h5>

  <p>If resources in an output file contain elements of the type <code>Attachment</code>, the server SHOULD populate the
    <code>Attachment.contentType</code> code as well as either the <code>data</code> element or the <code>url</code>
    element. When populated, the <code>url</code> element SHALL be an absolute url that can be de-referenced to the
    attachment’s content.
  </p>

  <p>When the <code>url</code> element is populated with an absolute URL and the <code>requiresAccessToken</code> field
    in the Complete Status body is set to <code>true</code>, the url location must be accessible by a client with a
    valid access token, and SHALL NOT require the use of additional authentication credentials. When the
    <code>url</code> element is populated and the <code>requiresAccessToken</code> field in the Complete Status body is
    set to <code>false</code> and no additional authorization-related extensions are present on a the Complete Status
    body's output entry, the url location SHALL be dereferenceable directly, and SHALL be short lived following the 
    expiration timing requirement that have been documented for bearer
    tokens in the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/authorization/index.html">SMART Backend Services Authorization Guide</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Note that if a server copies files to the Bulk Data output endpoint or proxies requests to facilitate access from
    this endpoint, it may need to modify the <code>Attachment.url</code> element when generating the Bulk Data output
    files.</p>
