<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
<b>Basic</b> is a special type of resource. Unlike all other resources, it doesn't correspond to a specific pre-defined HL7 concept. Instead, it's a placeholder for any resource-like concept that isn't already defined in the HL7 specification.
</p>

<p>
The Basic resource is intended for use in three circumstances:
</p>
<ol>
<li>When an implementer needs a resource concept that is likely to be defined by HL7 in the future but they have not yet done so (due to bandwidth issues, lack of sufficient requirements, lower prioritization, etc.)</li>
<li>When there's a need to convey a narrative-only construct that doesn't neatly correspond to one of the other resources, either because it combines aspects of several resources (e.g. Assessment + Plan) or because the allowed content is flexible such that the system can't be totally sure what sort of content might have been included in the narrative text.</li>
<li>Other than the circumstances above, this resource will see minimal use. To keep the FHIR specification manageable, it cannot incorporate every site-specific requirement that might be needed in some implementation somewhere. This set of resources likely won't ever be officially defined in HL7.</li>
</ol>

<p>
There's also a fourth circumstance: An implementer wishes to convey information that could/should be conveyed
using a standard resource, however they want to represent the information in a custom format that isn't
aligned with the official resource's elements.  While this resource would be the preferred way of meeting that
use-case because it will at least be wire-format compatible, such a use would not be conformant because
making use of the Basic resource would prevent the healthcare-related information from being safely processed,
queried and analyzed by other conformant systems.
</p>

<p>
Implementers don't need to be concerned with which of the three categories their desired resource fits within. If they need a resource and it clearly doesn't fit one of the ones currently defined, they should use Basic.
</p>

[%stu-note%]
That the <a href="versions.html#extensions">inter-version extension mechanism</a> 
might be used to allow <code>Basic</code> to represent resources that don't exist 
in the FHIR version being used for exchange, but no specific guidance is provided.  
If implementers are interested in having this further defined, they should share 
their use-case on <a href="http://chat.fhir.org">http://chat.fhir.org</a> and 
the committee might consider publishing out an implementation guide providing further 
guidance.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
Basic defines only a minimal set of data elements - those necessary to identify what kind of resource it
represents and those necessary to support resource <a href="compartmentdefinition.html">compartmenting</a>.  All other data elements
are represented using the <a href="extensibility.html">extension</a> mechanism.  It's entirely possible to have a
Basic resource instance with nothing other than narrative, a subject and code.  And, in practice, that's all many systems will understand.
