        <li>Criticality vs Severity</li>
        <p>Criticality is defined as "The potential seriousness of a future reaction."
            This represents a clinical judgment about the worst case scenario for a future reaction. 
            It would be based on the severity of past reactions, the dose and route of exposure that produced past reactions, 
            and the life-threatening or organ system threatening potential of the reaction type.   
            Criticality is an attribute of the allergic condition, not the reaction(s).
        </p>
        <p>
            High criticality does not equate to a future severe reaction, 
            but rather the potential for a severe and life-threatening reaction. 
            Most reaction types are dose dependent, including anaphylaxis. 
            Therefore, although they have a sensitivity of high criticality, 
            exposure to a small dose of the substance to which they are sensitive might result in only a mild reaction.  
            Severity of the reaction is also dependent on the route of exposure, 
            but criticality since it applies to the condition, is not.
