  <concept>
    <code value="status"/>
    <display value="Status"/>
    <definition value="A code that indicates the status of the concept. Typical values are active, experimental, deprecated, and retired"/>
  </concept>
  <concept>
    <code value="inactive"/>
    <display value="Inactive"/>
    <definition value="True if the concept is not considered active - e.g. not a valid concept any more. Property type is boolean, default value is false. Note that the status property may also be used to indicate that a concept is inactive"/>
  </concept>
  <concept>
    <code value="deprecated"/>
    <display value="Deprecated"/>
    <definition value="The date at which a concept was deprecated. Concepts that are deprecated but not inactive can still be used, but their use is discouraged, and they should be expected to be made inactive in a future release. Property type is dateTime. Note that the status property may also be used to indicate that a concept is deprecated"/>
  </concept>
  <concept>
    <code value="notSelectable"/>
    <display value="Not Selectable"/>
    <definition value="The concept is not intended to be chosen by the user - only intended to be used as a selector for other concepts. Note, though, that the interpretation of this is highly contextual; all concepts are selectable in some context. Property type is boolean"/>
  </concept>
  <concept>
    <code value="parent"/>
    <display value="Parent"/>
    <definition value="The concept identified in this property is a parent of the concept on which it is a property. The property type will be 'code'. The meaning of 'parent' is defined by the hierarchyMeaning attribute"/>
  </concept>
  <concept>
    <code value="child"/>
    <display value="Child"/>
    <definition value="The concept identified in this property is a child of the concept on which it is a property. The property type will be 'code'. The meaning of 'child' is defined by the hierarchyMeaning attribute"/>
  </concept>
  <concept>
    <code value="partOf"/>
    <display value="Part Of"/>
    <definition value="The concept identified in this property (by it's code) contains this concept as a component (i.e.. a part-of relationship rather than a subsumption relationship such as elbow is part-of arm"/>
  </concept>
  <concept>
    <code value="synonym"/>
    <display value="Synonym"/>
    <definition value="This property contains an alternative code that may be used to identify this concept instead of the primary code"/>
  </concept>
  <concept>
    <code value="comment"/>
    <display value="Comment"/>
    <definition value="A strng that provides additional detail pertinent to the use or understanding of the concept"/>
