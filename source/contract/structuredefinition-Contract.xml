The activityTime includes the times of component actions (such as preparation and clean-up). For Procedures and SubstanceAdministrations, the activityTime can provide a needed administrative function by providing a more inclusive time to be anticipated in scheduling. UsageNotes:The activityTime is primarily of administrative rather than clinical use. The clinically relevant time is the effectiveTime. When an observation of a prior symptom is made, the activityTime describes the time the observation is made, as opposed to effectiveTime which is the time the symptom is reported to have occurred. Thus the activityTime may be entirely different from the effectiveTime of the same Act. However, even apart from clinical use cases, designers should first consider effectiveTime as the primary relevant time for an Act. ActivityTime indicates when an Act occurs, not when it is recorded."/>

This element supports narrowing the area of concern to more specific term topics within this Contract. Given the wide range of contract topics, implementers need to be cognizant of the business use case for which they are designing a FHIR Contract, and narrowly specify the topic being represented with respect to the Contract.type and any specializing Contract.subtype. The same topic, e.g., an asset such as a good or service, such as a real property, medical supply, insurance, information, a procedure or employment, or a manner of conduct, such adherence to a privacy, trust, or security policy, may be the topic of multiple types of contracts. &#xD;One way to determine the Contract.topic is to answer the question: “What is the overall objective of this legal instrument. The Contract.topic is described with more detail by the terms of the Contract."/>

ActConsentType, which generalizes ActDataConsentType; ActFinancialParticipationConsentType; ActInformationAccessCode; AdvanceBeneficiaryNoticeType.  ActPolicyType, which generalizes: ActPrivacyPolicyType, ActSensitivityPrivacyPolicyType, ActSecurityPolicyType.  In the ActClass Code System:  CNTRCT (contract) Description: An agreement of obligation between two or more parties that is subject to contractual law and enforcement, lwhich generalizes FCNTRCT (financial contract) and COV (coverage).  POLICY (policy) - Description: A mandate, regulation, obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation unilaterally imposed by one party on: The activity of another party; the behavior of another party; or the manner in which an act is executed. LEAF CONCEPTS: JURISPOL (jurisdictional policy) Description:A mandate, regulation, obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation unilaterally imposed by a jurisdiction on: The activity of another party; the behavior of another party; or the manner in which an act is executed.Examples:A jurisdictional mandate regarding the prescribing and dispensing of a particular medication. A jurisdictional privacy or security regulation dictating the manner in which personal health information is disclosed. A jurisdictional requirement that certain services or health conditions are reported to a monitoring program, e.g., immunizations, methadone treatment, or cancer registries.ORGPOL (organizational policy)Examples:A clinical or research protocols imposed by a payer, a malpractice insurer, or an institution to which a provider must adhere. A mandate imposed by a denominational institution for a provider to provide or withhold certain information from the patient about treatment options.SCOPOL (scope of practice policy)Description:An ethical or clinical obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation imposed or strongly encouraged by organizations that oversee particular clinical domains or provider certification which define the boundaries within which a provider may practice and which may have legal basis or ramifications.Examples:An ethical obligation for a provider to fully inform a patient about all treatment options. An ethical obligation for a provider not to disclose personal health information that meets certain criteria, e.g., where disclosure might result in harm to the patient or another person. The set of health care services which a provider is credentialed or privileged to provide. STDPOL (standard of practice policy) Examples:A payer may require a prescribing provider to adhere to formulary guidelines. An institution may adopt clinical guidelines and protocols and implement these within its electronic health record and decision support systems.  CONS (consent)Description: The Consent class represents informed consents and all similar medico-legal transactions between the patient (or his legal guardian) and the provider. Examples are informed consent for surgical procedures, informed consent for clinical trials, advanced beneficiary notice, against medical advice decline from service, release of information agreement, etc..  The details of consents vary. Often an institution has a number of different consent forms for various purposes, including reminding the physician about the topics to mention. Such forms also include patient education material. In electronic medical record communication, consents thus are information-generating acts on their own and need to be managed similar to medical activities. Thus, Consent is modeled as a special class of Act. The &quot;signatures&quot; to the consent document are represented electronically through Participation instances to the consent object. Typically an informed consent has Participation.typeCode of &quot;performer&quot;, the healthcare provider informing the patient, and &quot;consenter&quot;, the patient or legal guardian. Some consent may associate a witness or a notary public (e.g., living wills, advanced directives). In consents where a healthcare provider is not required (e.g. living will), the performer may be the patient himself or a notary public."/>
