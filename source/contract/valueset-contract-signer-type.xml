The original document shall be referenced via an attribute in the new document, which contains, for example, the digest of the old document. Whether the original, unaltered, document is always displayed with the addended document is a local matter, but the original, unaltered, document must remain as part of the patient record and be retrievable on demand."/>

An administrative (error/edit) signature must include an addendum to the document and therefore shall have an addendum signature sub-type (see 8.1). This signature is reserved for the highest health information system administrative classification, since it is a statement that the entire document is invalidated by the error and that the document should no longer be used for patient care, although for legal reasons the document must remain part of the permanent patient record."/>
