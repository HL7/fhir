    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following scenario is based on existing
      jurisdictional policy and are realized in existing systems in Canada. The default policy is
      one of implied consent for the provision of care, so these scenarios all deal with withdrawal
      or withholding consent for that purpose. In other jurisdictions, where an express consent
      model is used (Opt-In), these would examples would contain the phrase "consent to" rather than
      "withhold" or "withdraw" consent for. <p> specific to use-case 5) Withhold or withdraw consent
        for disclosure of records that were authored by a specific organization (or service delivery
        location). </p><p> Patient "P. van de Heuvel" wishes to have all of the PHI collected at the
        Good Health Psychiatric Hospital restricted from disclosure to every provider. </p>
