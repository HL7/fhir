        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The Administrative module covers the base data that is then linked into
            the other modules for clinical content, finance/billing, workflow, etc.<br />
            This of course is built on the FHIR technology platform modules.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before any clinical data can be recorded, the basic information on the patient
            must be recorded, and then often the basis of the interaction (such as an encounter)

        <p>
            Most clinical actitivies occur grouped in some way. Long term care is typically covered by an EpisodeOfCare, where short term care by encounters. Account associates the tracking of transactions back to a Patient (or other resource). Flag is just used to highlight a warning or other notification about a patient (or other resource)

        <h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            Patient privacy is handled with security labels and tags in the Resource <a href="resource.html#Meta">Meta</a> property.
            This is the standard way that the FHIR specification provides this supporting information
            to a sub-system that implements it (which is not defined by FHIR).
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the more common use cases is for marking a patient as being a <a href="security-labels.html">celebrity</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that privacy considerations apply to Person, Practitioner and RelatedPerson records in addition to Patient's.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Organization, Location, Device and other non-person-identifying records are generally subject to less stringent
            security precautions, such data must still be protected to avoid safety issues
            (e.g. someone maliciously changing the ingredients associated with a drug to cause/fail to cause alerts)
        </p>
        <p>
            Devices can be linked to Patients.  If this occurs, they must be protected as any other patient-linked element
        </p>
        <p>
            For more general considerations, see <a href="secpriv-module.html">the Security and Privacy module</a>.

        <h3>Common use Cases</h3>
        <p>
            All systems require access to administrative resources, such as for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining master file lists of patients, practitioners, organizations, locations, etc.</li>
            <li>Synchronizing/interrogating content from an external registry. Such as a Services Directory or centralized Person register</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <a name="roadmap"> </a>
        <h3>Developmental Roadmap</h3>
        <p>
            The Patient Administration is currently working through resources that support:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encounters and Scheduling <i>(enhance maturity of encounters and further develop in/outpatient scheduling)</i></li>
            <li>Service Provider Directory <i>(in co-ordination with the Argonaut Provider Directory group)</i></li>
            <li>Financial Management interactions <i>(account/coverage, then billable item, which links administration to billing)</i></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Many of the administrative resources are part of the core resources that most systems
            use first and have formed the basis for most people's first experiences with FHIR.<br />
            However this limited exposure has still to be proven in all contexts, such as veterinary, public health and clinical research.
