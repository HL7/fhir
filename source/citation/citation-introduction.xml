<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>The scope of the Citation Resource is to describe any aspect of identification, location, authorship, and contributorship to a journal article, report, document, resource, or other knowledge artifact. Citations are used extensively in scholarly communication and important for documenting the evidence or source behind statements of fact, opinion, and interpretation. Citations are also used for acknowledgement of the contributions of individuals and groups to the creation and advancement of knowledge.</p>
<p>Across the academic and scientific community citations are used extensively to reference the knowledge artifacts contributing to current work. For any community searching for reports of research or scholarly publications (such as searching MEDLINE) the citations contain the metadata used for such searches. Standardization of citations supports interoperability across citation managers and adaptation to current needs, such as reports being available on preprint servers before 'final' peer-reviewed published form, need to cite datasets or other alternative forms of expression, or the ability to support citation of FHIR Resources where the FHIR Resource represents research or scholarly publication.</p>
<p>The Resource can accommodate both human and machine readers. The <i>summary</i> provides human-readable information.</p>
<p>Even the canonical article today is complex. The <i>variantCitation</i> accommodates versions, sets of articles, and multi-part articles including Supplements</p>
<p>Published articles usually have a title, called here <i>articleTitle</i>, although the <i>articleTitle</i> element can be used for the name of the book chapter or database entry when such articles are cited. All citations that are findable on the internet can have a <i>webLocation</i>.</p>
<p>Attribution is expressed as <i>contributorship</i>, which has grown more complicated as the very nature of authorship has become complicated, and as the concerns for credit and acknowledgement are increasingly complex. If a complex individualized attribution structure is not required, the <i>contributorship.summary</i> will do.</p>
<p>“Publication” must now cover books, books series, article series, database registries, database updates, and the like. The element, publicationForm, enables this complex description. Within <i>publicationForm</i>, the <i>publishedIn</i> element identifies the largest container (journal, book, database, or newspaper), the <i>periodicRelease</i> element identifies the periodic issue, and the remaining elements (covering dates, language, and pagination) are specific to the article being cited.</p>
<p>Many elements, including <i>classifier</i> and <i>keywordList</i> may include the system or source behind codable concepts. Nevertheless, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has played such an important role in curating references to the world’s biomedical literature, a <i>medline</i> element is included for backwards compatibility and to contain multiple elements for which NLM systems are the only relevant systems, thus reducing the need to code the system for data exchange.</p>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>

<p>Any resource may have common metadata including publisher, authors, reviewers, editors, endorsers, identifiers and location concepts for the resource. The Citation Resource is expected to be used primarily for citing things that are not FHIR Resources. There is NOT an expectation to provide Citations for most FHIR Resources. However, FHIR Resources can be the subject of Citation Resources when there is additional needs beyond common metadata to use the FHIR Resource as the cited source in other contexts or to support scholarly and scientific contribution attribution to the FHIR Resource content.</p>
