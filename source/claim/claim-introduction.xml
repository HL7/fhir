		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p>
The Claim is used by providers and payors, insurers, to exchange the financial information, and supporting clinical information, regarding the provision
 of health care services with payors and for reporting to regulatory bodies and firms which provide data analytics. The primary uses of this resource is to support eClaims, 
the exchange of information relating to the proposed or actual provision of healthcare-related goods and services for patients to their benefit payors, insurers and national health programs, for treatment payment planning and reimbursement.
		</p>
		<p>The Claim resource is a "request" resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html#request">Workflow Request.</a></p>

		<p>
The Claim resource may be interpreted differently depending on its intended use (and the Claim.use element contains the code to indicate):
			<ul>
				<li>claim - where the provision of goods and services is <b>complete</b> and adjudication under a plan and payment is sought.</li>
				<li>preauthorization - where the provision of goods and services is <b>proposed</b> and authorization and/or the reservation of funds is desired.</li>
				<li>predetermination - where the provision of goods and services is <b>explored</b> to determine what services may be covered and to what amount. Essentially a 'what if' claim.</li>
			</ul> 
		</p>

		<p>
The Claim also supports:
			<ul>
				<li>Up to a 3-tier hierarchy of Goods, products, and Services, to support simple to complex billing, see diagram below.</li>
				<li>Multiple insurance programs arranged in a Coordination of Benefit sequence to enable exchange with primary, secondary, tertiary etc. insurance coverages.</li>
				<li>Assignment of benefit - the benefit may be requested to be directed to the subscriber, the provider or another party.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>3-Tier Line Item Hierarchy</h3>
<p>
While most current eClaim data models current only support a single tier structure for line items, that is there is only a list of 'n' line items
to support exchanging multiple services where complex relations between line items are expressed through business rules such as 'put the professional fee
line item before the lab/device/service line item', the FHIR claim-related resources (Claim, ClaimResponse and ExplanationOfBenefit) all support a 3-tier
structure, as illustrated in the diagram below. The tiers are:
<ul> 
  <li>.item, which contains the context information, such as diagnosis and care team and body site, the item service identification and costing, 
  and an optional list of .details. When .details are provided the .item serves as a grouper where the .item costs are the sum of the .detail costs;</li> 
 <li>.detail, which contains detail service identification and costing, and an optional list of .subDetails. When .subDetails are provided 
 the .detail serves as a grouper where the .detail costs are the sum of the .subDetail costs; and</li> 
  <li>.subDetail, which contains detail service identification and costing.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

    </div>

<p>
The base FHIR specification provides for an unlimited numer of .items and within each .item and unlimited number or .details, and similarly 
and unlimited number of .subDetails within each .detail. It is up to the implementation guides and profiles to determine when .details and .subDetails are permitted
 and the allowable numbers of .items, .details and .subDetails.

		<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
		<p>The Claim resource is used to request the adjudication and/or authorization of a set of healthcare-related goods and services for a patient against the patient's insurance coverages, or
	to request what the adjudication would be for a supplied set of goods or services should they be actually supplied to the patient.</p>

		<p>When requesting whether the patient's coverage is inforce, whether it is valid at this or a specified date, or requesting the benefit details or preauthorization requirements 
	associated with a coverage, then <a href="coverageeligibilityrequest.html">CoverageEligibilityRequest</a> should be used instead.</p>

		<p>When using the resources for reporting and transferring claims data, which may have originated in some standard other than FHIR, the Claim resource is useful if only the
	request side of the information exchange is of interest. If, however, both the request and the adjudication information is to be reported then the 
			<a href="explanationofbenefit.html">ExplanationOfBenefit</a> should be used instead.</p>

		<p>For reporting out to patients or transferring data to patient centered applications, such as patient health Record (PHR) application, the <a href="explanationofbenefit.html">ExplanationOfBenefit</a> 
	should be used instead of the Claim and ClaimResponse resources as those resources may contain provider and payer specific information which is not appropriate for sharing with 
	the patient.</p>
