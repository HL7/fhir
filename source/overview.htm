<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) defines a set of resources for use in exchanging information about the healthcare process. 
Resources are:
</p>
<ul class="dense">
 <li>Atomic - they are the smallest defined unit of operation and have a transaction scope of their own</li>
 <li>Connected - resources refer to other resources to allow for clean modular reuse of information</li>
 <li>Independent - the content of a resource can be processed without having to retrieve referenced resources</li>
 <li>Simple - each resource definition is easy to understand, and to implement without needing specialized tooling or infrastructure (though that can be used if desired)</li>
 <li>RESTful - resources are able to be used in a RESTful exchange context</li>
 <li>Flexible - resources can also be used in non-RESTful contexts, such as messaging or SOA architectures and can be moved in and out of RESTful paradigms as convenient</li>
 <li>Extensible - resources can be extended to allow for local requirements without impacting interoperability</li>
 <li>Webcentric - where possible and appropriate, open internet standards are used for data representation</li>
 <li>Free for use - the FHIR specification itself is open - anyone can implement FHIR or derive related specifications without any IP restrictions</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to the basic resources, FHIR defines a lightweight implementation framework that supports the use of these 
resources in RESTful environments, classic message exchanges, human-centric clinical documents and enterprise SOA 
architectures. Each of these approaches provides its own benefits - FHIR provides the underpinning enablement that
makes the choosing one of these painless and enables enterprises to choose their own paradigm without forsaking 
interoperability with other approaches.
</p>
<p>
Though the resources are simple and easy to understand, they are backed by a thorough, global 
requirements gathering and formal modeling process that ensures that the content of the resources 
is stable and reliable. The resource contents are mapped to solid underlying ontologies and 
models using computable languages (including RDF) so that the definitions and contents of the 
resources can be leveraged by computational analysis and conversion processes.
</p>
<p>
FHIR also provides an underlying conformance framework and tooling that allows different implementation
contexts and enterprises to describe their context and use of resources in formal computable ways and
to empower computed interoperability that leverages both the conformance and definitional frameworks. 
</p>
<p>
The combination of the resources and the 3 supporting layers (implementation frameworks, definitional
thoroughness, and conformance tooling), along with the completely free license of FHIR itself 
frees healthcare data so that it can easily flow to where it needs to be (across hospital 
production systems, mobile clinical systems, cloud based data stores, national health repositories, 
research databases, etc.) without having to pass through format and semantic inter-conversion hurdles along the way. 
</p>
<p>
Compared to the all the other approaches, FHIR... [-- Obligatory: insert your <span style="text-decoration: line-through">FHIR</span> FIRE related joke here --].
