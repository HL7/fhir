<h2>FHIR Roadmap</h2>
<p>
Welcome to the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Specification. This page provides a road map for first-time readers of the specification to help find your way around FHIR quickly. 
</p>
<p>
Broadly, the FHIR specification is broken up into 3 parts: 
</p>
<ul>
 <li>General <a href="documentation.htm">documentation</a> that describes how <a href="resources.htm">resources are defined</a>, 
   and gives background material including definitions of <a href="datatypes.htm">data types</a>, <a href="terminologies.htm">codes</a>, and the <a href="xml.htm">XML</a> and <a href="json.htm">JSON formats</a></li>
 <li><a href="implementation.htm">Implementation</a> - how to use resources using <a href="http.htm">REST</a>, <a href="message.htm">Messaging</a>, as <a href="document.htm">clinical documents</a>, or in a <a href="soa.htm">service based architecture</a></li>
 <li>The <a href="resourcelist.htm">resource list</a> - a list of all the resources defined by FHIR. You can also get lists 
     for <a href="clinical.htm">clinical</a>, <a href="administration.htm">administrative</a> and <a href="infrastructure.htm">infrastructural</a> resources</li>
</ul>
<p>
Resources have a wide range of uses, from pure clinical content such as <a href="careplan.htm">care plans</a> and <a href="diagnosticreport.htm">diagnostic reports</a> through to pure infrastructure
such as <a href="message.htm">messaging</a> and <a href="conformance.htm">conformance</a> statements. They all share common technical characteristics (see below for a more formal definition), 
but they are used in totally different fashions. Note that you do not have to use REST to make use of resources.
</p>

<h3>Where to Start</h3>
<p>
The best place to start is to quickly read the <a href="resourcelist.htm">Resources</a> list to get a sense of what resources exist and then look at 
the <a href="patient.htm">Patient resource</a> definition to see what resource definitions look like, and then read these background pages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="resources.htm">Resource Definitions</a> - basic background to how resources are defined</li>
  <li>About Resources: the <a href="narrative.htm">Narrative</a> they all contain, and how <a href="references.htm">Resources refer to each other</a></li>
  <li><a href="formats.htm">Formats</a>: <a href="xml.htm">XML</a> and <a href="json.htm">JSON</a></li>
  <li>About <a href="extensibility.htm">Extensibility</a>: a key way that the specification is kept simple</li>
</ul>

<h4>Header Tabs</h4>
<p>
These header tabs found through-out the specification are important, and many readers miss them:

</p>
<p>
Resources and the <a href="datatypes.htm">data types</a> that they use are presented in an concise easy to read XML-like format,
but they also have formal definitions that describe their contents in considerable detail. In addition, most resources are mapped to several
different formats, including HL7 v2, the HL7 v3 RIM, CDA, DICOM, and others. Also, all resources come with at least one example (sometimes 
many more) and, where appropriate, with profiles that describe their use in specific circumstances. Finally, some resources include 
notes that helps implementers understand the design rationale underlying them. 
</p>

<h3>The FHIR Wiki</h3>
<p>
The FHIR project team also maintains a <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR">wiki</a> where 
development processes, methodology and design decisions are documented. [todo: LLOYD FILL IN MORE].
