<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<div>
<!-- Describes some of the situations/use cases intended to be managed with the resource. May include a child div for "Storyboards" and "Related Specifications". The purpose of this section is to help implementers understand why the resource is needed and how it might be used. -->
    <p>
        This resource records the use of a healthcare-related device by the patient, a provider or a related person, and is primarily used for patient-reported or second-hand reporting. The resource can be used to note the use of an assistive device such as a wheelchair or hearing aid, a contraceptive, or an implanted device such as a pacemaker. It may also be used, for example, to capture an approximate assertion that the patient used the device over a six month period.
    </p>
   <p>This resource is an <em>event</em> resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a>.</p>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
There are several resources that can be used to represent device use events or requests. The following Resources should be used in the following manner:
</p>
<p> 
<a href="devicerequest.html">DeviceRequest</a> - records a request to use the device.
</p>

<p> 
<a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a>- records the implant or explant event of a device in a patient.
</p>

<p> 
<a href="deviceassociation.html">DeviceAssociation</a> - If precise information (e.g., from the assigning system) about the association of the device with the patient is known, DeviceAssociation is the typical mechanism to record the information.
