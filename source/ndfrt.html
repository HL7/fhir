<h3>Summary</h3>

<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>Source</td><td>National Drug File – Reference Terminology prepared by <a href="http://www.va.gov/health/">Veterans Health Administration</a>, 
   and distributed as part of <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/">UMLS</a> by the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM</a> (<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/NDFRT/">direct link</a>)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>System</td><td>The URI to identify NDF-RT is not resolved. As a temporary arrangement, the URL "<code>http://hl7.org/fhir/ndfrt</code>" is to be used</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Version</td><td>A version is not needed. Use the date of release of the UMLS release for the version of NDF-RT if a version is desired</td></tr>

<i>This URL is temporary while the NDF-RT and FHIR teams discuss the
long term arrangements</i>. Further documentation can be <a href="http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NDF-RT/NDF-RT%20Documentation.pdf">found

<h3>Version Issues</h3>
<p>
NDF-RT is released as part of UMLS, and therefore each successive release has the date of the UMLS release as its version.
</p>

<h3>Copyright/License Issues</h3>

<p>
NDF-RT has no copyright acknowledgement needed, but users must adhere to the UMLS license.
</p>

<h3>NDF-RT Filter Properties</h3>


<p>
This section documents the property filters that can be used with the SNOMED CT
code system in value set composition statements.
</p>


<h4>By Subsumption</h4>

<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>Description</td><td>Select a set of concepts based on subsumption testing</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Property Name</td><td>concept</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Operations Allowed</td><td>is-a</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Values Allowed</td><td>NUI</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Comments</td><td>Includes all concepts that have a transitive is-a relationship with the concept Id provided in the value as an NUI</td></tr>
