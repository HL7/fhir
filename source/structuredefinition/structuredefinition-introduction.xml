<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The StructureDefinition resource describes a structure - a set of data element definitions, and their associated rules of usage.
These structure definitions are used to describe both the content defined in the FHIR specification
itself - Resources, data types, the underlying infrastructural types, and also are used to describe how
these structures are used in implementations.
This allows the definitions of the structures to be shared and published through
repositories of structure definitions, compared with each other, and used as the basis
for code, report and UI generation.
</p>
<p>
Note that  as part of the specification itself, a <a href="downloads.html#profiles">full
set of structure definitions</a> for all resources and data types is published.
</p>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<ul>
 <li>StructureDefinitions are used by <a href="capabilitystatement.html">CapabilityStatement</a> instances for specifying how resources are used</li>
 <li>StructureDefinitions use <a href="valueset.html">Value Sets</a> to specify the content of coded elements</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
Implementers should be familiar with the
background and concepts described in <a href="profiling.html">Profiling FHIR</a>
before working with this resource.

<h3>Metadata</h3>
<p>
The StructureDefinition resource has a set of metadata that is mostly shared with the <a href="valueset.html">Value Set</a>,
<a href="capabilitystatement.html">CapabilityStatement</a> and other infrastructure resources. The metadata describes the structure and helps
find the structure when registered in repositories.

<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>url</td><td>The identifier that is used to identify this structure when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This URL is where the structure can be accessed</td></tr>
 <tr><td>identifier</td><td>Other identifiers that are used to identify this structure</td></tr>
 <tr><td>version</td><td>
   <p>The identifier that is used to identify this version of the structure definition when it is 
      referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed 
      by the structure definition author and is not expected to be globally unique. There is no 
      expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence, so authors are encouraged 
      to populate the StructureDefinition.versionAlgorithm[x] element to enable comparisons. If 
      there is no managed version available, authors can consider using ISO date/time syntax (e.g., "2023-01-01").
      This is a business versionId, not a resource version id (see <a href="resource.html#versions">discussion</a>).
    </p>
    <p>Note that there may be multiple resource versions of the structure that have this same identifier. 
     The resource will have updates that create new versions for technical reasons, whereas the stated version number needs to be under the author's control.
     The version can be appended to the url in a reference to allow a reference to a particular business version of the structure definition with the format [url]|[version].

 <tr><td>fhirVersion</td><td>The version of the FHIR specification on which this structure is based. It is not necessary to specify the version, 
 as most StructureDefinitions are valid across multiple versions, and the validity of a structure against a particular version of FHIR can easily be checked by tooling.</td></tr>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name and title of the structure are not required to be globally unique, but the name and title should have some scoping information (e.g. AcmeAllergies / Acme Inc. (USA), Allergy List)</li>
<li>Multiple keywords may be assigned to the structure. These may either describe the structure, the focus of the structure or both. They are solely to help find the structure by searching for structured concepts</li>
<li>The 3 status codes (draft, active, and retired) are the codes that are relevant to structure consumers. Authors may wish to use the <a href="#author-status">authoring-status</a> extension to track the life cycle of a structure as it is prepared</li>
