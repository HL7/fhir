<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The StructureDefinition resource describes a structure - a set of data element definitions, and their associated rules of usage.
These structure definitions are used to describe both the content defined in the FHIR specification
itself - Resources, data types, the underlying infrastructural types, and also are used to describe how
these structures are used in implementations.
This allows the definitions of the structures to be shared and published through
repositories of structure definitions, compared with each other, and used as the basis
for code, report and UI generation.
</p>
<p>
Note that  as part of the specification itself, a <a href="downloads.html#profiles">full
set of structure definitions</a> for all resources and data types is published.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<ul>
 <li>StructureDefinitions are used by <a href="capabilitystatement.html">CapabilityStatement</a> instances for specifying how resources are used</li>
 <li>StructureDefinitions use <a href="valueset.html">Value Sets</a> to specify the content of coded elements</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
Implementers should be familiar with the
background and concepts described in <a href="profiling.html">Profiling FHIR</a>
before working with this resource.

<h3>Metadata</h3>
<p>
The StructureDefinition resource has a set of metadata that is mostly shared with the <a href="valueset.html">Value Set</a>,
<a href="capabilitystatement.html">CapabilityStatement</a> and other infrastructure resources. The metadata describes the structure and helps
find the structure when registered in repositories.

<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>url</td><td>The identifier that is used to identify this structure when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This URL is where the structure can be accessed</td></tr>
 <tr><td>identifier</td><td>Other identifiers that are used to identify this structure</td></tr>
 <tr><td>version</td><td>
   <p>The identifier that is used to identify this version of the structure when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the structure author manually and the value should be a timestamp.</p>
   <p>Note that there may be multiple resource versions of the structure that have this same identifier. The resource will have updates that create new versions for technical reasons, whereas the stated version number needs to be under the author's control</p>
   </td></tr>
 <tr><td>versionAlgorithm</td><td>Indicates the mechanism used to compare versions to determine which is more current</td></tr>
 <tr><td>name</td><td>A Computer-ready name (e.g. a token) that identifies the structure - suitable for code generation. 
   Note that this name (and other names relevant for code generation, including element &amp; slice names, codes etc) may collide with reserved words in the relevant target language, and code generators will need to handle this </td></tr>
 <tr><td>title</td><td>A free text natural language name identifying the structure	</td></tr>
 <tr><td>status</td><td>The status of the structure	allows filtering of StructureDefinitions that are appropriate for use vs. not. See the <a href="valueset-publication-status.html">Status Codes</a></td></tr>
 <tr><td>experimental</td><td>This structure was authored for testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended for genuine usage</td></tr>
 <tr><td>date</td><td>The date this version of the structure was published	</td></tr>
 <tr><td>publisher</td><td>Details of the individual or organization who accepts responsibility for publishing the structure. This helps establish the "authority/credibility" of the structure.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>contact</td><td>Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the publisher</td></tr>
 <tr><td>description</td><td>A free text natural language description of the structure and its use</td></tr>

 <tr><td>copyright</td><td>Use and/or publishing restrictions</td></tr>
 <tr><td>fhirVersion</td><td>The version of the FHIR specification on which this structure is based. It is not necessary to specify the version, 
 as most StructureDefinitions are valid across multiple versions, and the validity of a structure against a particular version of FHIR can easily be checked by tooling.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>type</td><td>The type the structure describes.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>contextType &amp; context</td><td>For extensions, the types of contexts in which the extension can be used. For further details, see <a href="defining-extensions.html">Defining Extensions</a></td></tr>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name and title of the structure are not required to be globally unique, but the name and title should have some scoping information (e.g. AcmeAllergies / Acme Inc. (USA), Allergy List)</li>
<li>Multiple keywords may be assigned to the structure. These may either describe the structure, the focus of the structure or both. They are solely to help find the structure by searching for structured concepts</li>
<li>The 3 status codes (draft, active, and retired) are the codes that are relevant to structure consumers. Authors may wish to use the <a href="#author-status">authoring-status</a> extension to track the life cycle of a structure as it is prepared</li>
