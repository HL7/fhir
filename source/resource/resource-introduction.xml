<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
This specification defines a series of different types of resource that can be used to exchange and/or store data 
in order to solve a wide range of healthcare related problems, both clinical and administrative. In addition,
this specification defines several different ways of exchanging the resources.
</p>
<p>
A resource is an entity that:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>has a known identity by which it can be addressed</li>
 <li>identifies itself as one of the types of resource defined in this specification</li>
 <li>contains a set of structured data items as described by the definition of the resource type</li>
 <li>has an identified version that changes if the contents of the resource change</li>
</ul>
<p>
Resources have <a href="resource-formats.html">multiple representations</a>. 
</p>
<!--
<p>
Basic definitions:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr> <td>Resource</td> <td>An instance of data that is stored or exchanged</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>Resource Definition</td> <td>Defines the data elements that are part of the resource</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>Profile</td> <td>Additional rules about the data elements for a particular context of use. There's a specific type of resource - the <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition Resource</a> that is used to represent a profile</td> </tr>
</table>
-->

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>

<p>
The following optional elements and properties are defined for all resources:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>An identity</li>
 <li>Meta data</li>
 <li>A base language</li>
 <li>A reference to "Implicit Rules"</li>
</ul>
<p>
Resource is the ancestor of <a href="domainresource.html">DomainResource</a> from which most recources are derived. <a href="bundle.html">Bundle</a>, <a href="parameters.html">Parameters</a>, and <a href="binary.html">Binary</a> extend Resource directly.
</p>
<p>
Note: there is documentation for the <a href="formats.html">Structure</a>, <a href="formats.html#uml">UML</a>, <a href="xml.html">XML</a>, and <a href="json.html">JSON</a> representations of the resource structure.
