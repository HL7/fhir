<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The Media resource contains photos, videos, and audio recordings. It is used with media acquired or used as part of the healthcare process. Here are some typical usages:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Photos of patients and staff for identification purposes</li>
 <li>Photos and videos of diagnostic or care provision procedures for recording purposes </li>
 <li>Storing scans and faxes of paper documents where not enough metadata exists to create a <a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a></li>
 <li>Images on diagnostic reports</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>

<p>
The Media resource is able to contain medical images in a DICOM format. These images may also be made accessible 
through an <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> resource, which provides a direct reference to the
image to a <a href="ftp://medical.nema.org/medical/dicom/final/sup161_ft.pdf">WADO-RS server</a>.
</p>
<p>
For such images, the WADO-RS framework is a preferred method for representing the images - the WADO-RS
service may include rendering the image with annotations and display parameters from an associated DICOM 
presentation state, for instance. 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the media resource allows for a robust transfer of an image across boundaries where
the WADO-RS service is not available. For this reason, medical images can also be represented in 
a Media resource, but the Media.content.url should provide a reference to a source WADO-RS service 
for the image.
