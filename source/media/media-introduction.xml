<p>The Media resource contains photos, videos, and audio recordings. It is used with media acquired or used as part of the healthcare process. Here are some typical usages:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Photos of patients and staff for identification purposes</li>
 <li>Photos and videos of diagnostic or care provision procedures for recording purposes </li>
 <li>Storing scans and faxes of paper documents where not enough metadata exists to create a <a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a></li>
 <li>Images on diagnostic reports</li> 
</ul>
<p>
The Media resource may contain medical images in a DICOM format.  While such images may also be accessible through an <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> resource, the Media 
resource enables "ready for presentation" access to a specific image. 

Such images would preferentially be made available in a FHIR ecosystem by the 
Media.content.url providing a reference to a WADO-RS service to access the image. 
That WADO-RS service may include rendering the image with annotations and display parameters 
from an associated DICOM presentation state.

Although the Media resource is allowed to contain images collected by a DICOM based system, DICOM images would preferentially be made available in a FHIR ecosystem
by provision of an  resource with references to a <a href="ftp://medical.nema.org/medical/dicom/supps/LB/sup161_lb.pdf">WADO-RS server</a>.
