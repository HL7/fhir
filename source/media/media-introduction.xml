<p>The Media resource contains photos, videos, and audio recordings. It is used with media acquired or used as part of the healthcare process. Here are some typical usages:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Photos of patients and staff for identification purposes</li>
 <li>Photos and videos of diagnostic or care provision procedures for recording purposes </li>
 <li>Storing scans and faxes of paper documents where not enough metadata exists to create a <a href="documentreference.htm">DocumentReference</a></li>
 <li>Images on diagnostic reports</li> 
</ul>
<p>
Although the Media resource is allowed to contain images collected by a DICOM based system, DICOM images would preferentially be made available in a FHIR ecosystem
by provision of an <a href="imagingstudy.htm">ImagingStudy</a> resource with references to a <a href="ftp://medical.nema.org/medical/dicom/supps/LB/sup161_lb.pdf">WADO-RS server</a>.
