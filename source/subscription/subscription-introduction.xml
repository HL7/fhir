  <h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
  <p>
    This document contains information about the <code>Subscription</code> resource and details specific to options in it. 
    See <a href="subscriptions.html">Subscriptions</a> for general information about using Subscriptions in FHIR.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>Subscription</code> resource is used to establish proactive event notifications from a FHIR server to another system. 
    Notifications are triggered by state changes or events defined by a <a href="subscriptiontopic.html">SubscriptionTopic</a> that 
    the server supports, referenced by a canonical URL. Notifications can be further refined by supplying filters specific to an 
    individual client. Each <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> resource defines a set of allowed filters 
    (<code>SubscriptionTopic.trigger.canFilterBy</code>), which can be referred to within a <code>Subscription</code> resource 
    (<code>Subscription.filterBy</code>).  Once a subscription is created, any triggering state change the specified 
    <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> that meets the filtering criteria will cause a notification to be sent using the provided channel.
    Notifications are <a href="bundle.html#subscription-notification">Bundle</a> resources, of type <code>subscription-notification</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Subscriptions are active resources; a server can only accept a subscription
    if it will execute the specified channel for any resources subsequently
    received. The subscription is no longer active once it is deleted from
    the server.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using the <code>Subscription.content</code>, subscriptions can be configured to send notifications that include full resource 
    content, just the ID of the triggering resource, or an empty notification body.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several channels are defined in the core specification:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#rest-hook"><b>rest-hook</b></a>: Notifications are sent via HTTPS POST to the <code>Subscription.endpoint</code> URL (e.g., <code>https://...</code>)</li>
    <li><a href="#websockets"><b>websocket</b></a>: Notifications are sent via WS/S to a client connected via a WebSocket</li>
    <li><a href="#email"><b>email</b></a>: Notifications are sent via SMTP/S, S/MIME, or Direct SMTP to the <code>Subscription.endpoint</code> email URI (e.g., <code>mailto:...</code>)</li>
    <li><a href="#messaging"><b>message</b></a>: Notifications are sent via <a href="messaging.html">FHIR messaging</a> to the application identified in the <code>Subscription.endpoint</code> URI</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Additional channel types can be <a href="#channel-extending">defined</a> by external implementation guides.
    See below for further discussion of the various channels.

  <h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>Subscription</code> resource is used in the <a href="subscriptions.html">Subscriptions Framework</a>.  Information about the Boundaries 
    and Relationships both within the Subscriptions Framework and to other areas of the FHIR specification can be found <a href="subscriptions.html#bnr">here</a>.
