<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
Once a subscription is created, any newly created or updated resources 
that meet the criteria in the resource cause a notification to be sent using the 
provided channel. The criteria are <a href="search.html">Search</a> strings
that have the same interpretation as if they were appended to the base 
URL and submitted using the REST API. Note that the search criteria 
are applied to the new value of the resource. The consequence of this 
is that there is no notification when a resource is deleted, or when 
a resource is updated so that it no longer meets the criteria. 
</p>
<p>
The server is able to send notifications without any information about the matching resource, or with the entire resource.
</p>
<p>
Several different types of channels are supported:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>rest-hook</b>: A post is made to the URL. If the subscription requests that the whole resource is included, the URL is interpreted as the service base</li>
 <li><b>websocket</b>: A PING message is sent to the designated URI</li>
 <li><b>email/sms</b>: A notification is send to nominated email address or SMS number</li>
 <li><b>message</b>: The resource is sent to the application identified in the URI as a <a href="messaging.html">message</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
See below for further discussion of the various channels. Note that sending
the entire resource creates security concerns that must be managed by the server.
</p>
<p>
Subscriptions are active resources; a server can only accept a subscription
if it will execute the specified channel for any resources subsequently 
received. The subscription is no longer active once it is deleted from 
the server.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
As an alternative to subscriptions, the RESTful API describes a 
polling-based subscription method using <a href="bundle.html">bundles</a> 
and the <a href="http.html#history">history operation</a>. This method 
of polling allows for a much tighter relationship between the client and 
the server that doesn't involve missing updates and/or deletes.
