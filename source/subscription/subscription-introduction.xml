<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The subscription resource is used to define a push-based transaction from a server to another system.  A suscriber subscribes to one or more predefined <a href="topic.html">Topics</a> which the server supports. Subscribers typically receive only a subset of the total event notifications for a given topic by filtering on the content. The filtering criteria are defined by the Topic resource.  Once a subscription is created, any topics that meet the filtering criteria cause a notification to be sent using the provided channel.
</p>
<p>
The server is able to send notifications without any information about the matching resource, or with the entire resource.
</p>
<p>
Several different types of channels are supported:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>rest-hook</b>: A notification is POSTed to the client nominated URL identified in the Subscription resource.</li>
 <li><b>websocket</b>: A PING message is sent to the designated URI</li>
 <li><b>email/sms</b>: A notification is sent to the nominated email address or SMS number</li>
 <li><b>message</b>: The resource is sent to the application identified in the URI as a <a href="messaging.html">message</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
See below for further discussion of the various channels. Note that sending
the entire resource creates security concerns that must be managed by the server.
</p>
<p>
Subscriptions are active resources; a server can only accept a subscription
if it will execute the specified channel for any resources subsequently
received. The subscription is no longer active once it is deleted from
the server.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
As an alternative to subscriptions, the RESTful API describes a
polling-based subscription method using <a href="bundle.html">bundles</a>
and the <a href="http.html#history">history operation</a>. This method
of polling allows for a much tighter relationship between the client and
the server that doesn't involve missing updates and/or deletes.
</p>
<p>
When using the <code>Subscription</code> resource, the FHIR server combines
the roles of publisher and information distributer. Other arrangements
of the publish and subscribe pattern describe separate agents for the two roles.
Implementers may implement the <code>Subscription</code> resource using an
architecture with separate agents, or using any other pub/sub architectire
(e.g. see <a href="http://fhircast.org/">FHIRCast</a>, or, more generally,
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/">W3C Pub/Sub</a>).
