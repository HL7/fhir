<p>
This page summarizes the use of SNOMED CT in the base FHIR Specification.
It is used by HL7 and IHTSDO to help with SNOMED CT licensing management.
</p>
<p>
In principle, this base FHIR Specification only uses concepts
defined in the International distribution of SNOMED CT, while
FHIR implementation guides that use SNOMED CT are generally published
by HL7 Affiliates under agreements with National distribution centers.
However, there are some US specific codes on this page; HL7 is working
with IHTSDO towards remove these from the specification (hopefully
they will be elevated to the international SNOMED CT distribution).
