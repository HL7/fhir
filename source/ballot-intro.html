<p>
Welcome to the second round of the FHIR Release 4 (R4) ballot, which is working toward our first release planned to include normative content. 
The R4 release of FHIR will have content with different ballot statuses: 
</p>
<ul>
 <li><span style="background-color: #e6ffe6; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Normative</b></span>: Content that is subject to normative ballot rules. Once passed, <a href="versions.html#change">strict rules</a> are imposed on future change to help ensure inter-version compatibility</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #fff5e6; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Trial Use</b></span>: Content that is undergoing <a href="versions.html#maturity">FHIR maturity Model</a> based testing. In a future ballot cycle, once sufficiently mature, it will be balloted as normative</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #ffffe6; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Informative</b></span>: Content that is advisory (e.g. implementers are not required to conform to the content), or navigational content - tables of contents, generated lists, etc.</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #efefef; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Draft</b></span>: Content added late in the balloting process that has no formal standing, but is published for visibility. It might not be suitable for use in production systems.</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #ffcccc; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Deprecated</b></span>: Content that is in the process of being removed (see <a href="versions.html#deprecation">deprecation</a>).</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #e6ffff; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>External</b></span>: Content that is replicated from external standards (e.g. HL7 v2, DICOM) and is not subject to ballot comment</li>
</ul>

<a name="process"></a>
<h3>The FHIR R4 Ballot Process</h3>

<p>
The FHIR R4 ballot process is significantly more complex than previous ballots because of the introduction of 
content on the normative track.
</p>
<p>
Three ballot periods are anticipated:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr>
   <td>Draft Ballot</td>
   <td>Dec 2017 - Jan 2018</td>
   <td>This first ballot was mainly a development ballot for the FHIR team. It allowed for:
     <ul>
       <li>The community to review the packaging and publication of the normative content</li>
       <li>The FHIR Management Group to hone ballot procedures</li>
       <li>Ongoing review of the FHIR content - particularly that marked as candidate-normative</li>
     </ul>  
   </td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Full FHIR Ballot</td>
   <td>Apr 2018 - May 2018</td>
   <td>The full R4 ballot. It included:
     <ul>
       <li>Multiple packages of normative content (see below)</li>
       <li>The rest of the content balloted for "Trial Use"</li>
     </ul>  
   </td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><b>Follow up Ballot</b></td>
   <td>Aug 2018 - Sep 2018</td>
   <td>A follow up ballot
     <ul>
       <li>Reballoting of normative content where substantive changes were required in response to ballot and implementer feedback</li>
       <li>Additional significant new (added post the full FHIR ballot) or significantly revised content balloted for "Trial Use"</li>
     </ul>  
     <b>This is the current ballot</b>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
The key driver of this complexity is the introduction of normative content. HL7's 
ballot rules for normative content require that if any substantive changes are
made as a result of ballot reconciliation, the content must be reballoted.
(Note that 'substantive changes' means any change that is likely to change
implementations - a very low bar). 
</p>
<p>
In the past, normative ballots have undergone many cycles of balloting, a process
that can take years. The FHIR ballot will be different, in that there are 2 ballot
cycles allowed; any normative content that cannot pass ballot with 2 cycles will
fall back to Trial Use for R4, and HL7 will try again for FHIR R5. Note that 
the content on the normative track has already undergone extensive testing,
production implementation, and previous ballots.
</p>
<p>
To facilitate this process, the ballot is broken up into multiple normative 
packages:
</p>
<table class="rows">
 <tr>
   <th>Infrastructure</th>
   <td>Abstract base types, data types, formats, the RESTful API, and content and typing rules</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <th>Terminology and Conformance</th>
   <td>The terminology infrastructure and the base resources that define FHIR implementations</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <th>Patient</th>
   <td>The Patient resource and related content</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <th>Observation</th>
   <td>The Observation resource and related content</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
A full list of the pages that are in each normative package can be found below.
Any content that is not in these packages is considered to be part of the general 
Trial Use Ballot.
</p>
<p>
In addition to these ballots of the core FHIR specification, several implementation guides are undergoing ballot as well.
</p>

<a name="background"></a>
<h3>R4 Ballot Background</h3>

<p>
Release 4 of the FHIR specification provides thousands of significant changes and enhancements 
from the third FHIR Standard for Trial Use specification HL7 published in May, 2017.  
These changes resulted from committee meetings, connectathons, over a thousand change proposals, and 
collaborations with other standards organizations.  A <a href="history.html#v1.6.0">summary of changes</a>  
and a <a href="diff.html">complete list of changes to resources and data types</a> are available, along with 
<a href="r3maps.html">transforms</a> between R3 and R4 for many resources.
</p>
<p>
The FHIR specification is presented as a series of interlinked HTML pages.  They can either be reviewed online or can be
<a href="fhir-spec.zip">downloaded</a> for exploration on your own device.  (175MB zip, ~1GB unzipped). The scope of
this FHIR Ballot is any page where the URL starts with http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep, though balloters must pay careful
attention to which ballot package content is in (see below, or the <a href="toc.html">Table of Contents</a>).
</p>
<p>
A few notes to consider when balloting:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pay close attention to the ballot status and FMM level of the artifacts.  More scrutiny is appropriate for higher-maturity artifacts.  
  While feedback is welcome for all content, expect draft and low maturity content to be a bit rough around the edges.</li>
  <li>Not all of the existing outstanding issues will be resolved prior to the ballot passing.  Some may be left open to allow feedback 
  from the early adopter community.</li>
  <li>While many applications have used the FHIR specification in production, the functionality it covers is not yet complete.  
  Resources may evolve and new ones will be introduced over time.  Refer to <a href="versions.html">FHIR 
  Timelines</a> for additional guidance on expectations around the evolution of the FHIR specification.  Also look at the road maps on the module pages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Balloting Guidelines</h3>
<p>
HL7 ballot rules require that participants sign up prior to opening of the ballot.  If you did not sign up in advance, you
can still submit comments using the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir-issues">Propose a Change</a>
link at the bottom of each page of the specification.  Feedback from balloters will be given priority but all suggestions will be
considered as much as time allows.  (And be sure to <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Mailing+List+Instructions">sign up</a> 
to the FHIR list-server and/or follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fhir">#FHIR</a> hash-tag so you don't miss the chance to 
vote in the next ballot cycle.)
</p>
<p>
If you are signed up to ballot, you can download the balloting spreadsheet from the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/participate/onlineballoting.cfm">Ballot Desktop</a>.
All ballot feedback must be provided using the spreadsheet template provided.  (There's a help tab that explains the meaning of each of the columns.)
For FHIR, you have the option of making your comments directly in the spreadsheet or submitting your comment using the FHIR
<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir-issues">Change Tracker</a> tool.  <b></b>  If you take the latter approach, you <b>must</b> include a reference to each tracker item in your
ballot spreadsheet along with a vote (negative, affirmative typo, etc.).  The other columns can (and should) be left blank.  All spreadsheets must be submitted along with an overall vote
by end of day Eastern time on the designated ballot closure date for the comments to be considered as part of ballot disposition.
</p>
<p style="background-color:yellow">
  <b>IMPORTANT:</b> We encourage  balloters to capture their comments using the HL7 issue tracker
  and to use the spreadsheet only to list their tracker item numbers and votes.  (If you include additional information beyond tracker item and vote, we 
  need to cross-check to ensure the content is aligned, which eliminates any savings.  So if you keep additional columns for internal review, please wipe them before submission.)
  Tracker-based comment submission dramatically reduces administrative overhead in managing the ballot.
  It also means that you can receive automatic notifications when your comment is scheduled for discussion, commented on, or resolved.  
</p>

<p>
When submitting your ballot feedback, if you have a general comment on something that you see occurring multiple times, please include 
at least a couple of specific locations where you see the issue.  As much as possible, capture each separate concern as a distinct row 
in the ballot sheet or separate <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir-issues">tracker item</a>.  (If using tracker items for your submissions, you <b>MUST</b> still
submit a ballot spreadsheet referencing the relevant tracker items.)  It makes our job of reconciling much easier.  Also, don't forget to 
fill in the section numbers (gray numbers to the left of each heading) and URLs.  Only one URL should be placed in the "url" element or column.  
If you want to reference additional URLs, include them in the text of your ballot comment.
</p>
<p>
If you have questions that are interfering with the ability to review the specification or submit ballot comments, please contact one of 
the co-chairs of the FHIR Management Group: <a href="mailto:lloyd@lmckenzie.com">Lloyd McKenzie</a> or 
<a href="mailto:david.hay25@gmail.com">David Hay</a>.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for taking the time to review the FHIR specification.  We appreciate any feedback you can provide.
</p>

<a name="round2"></a>
<h3>Rules for Round 2 Ballot (Follow up ballot)</h3>

<p>
This is the round 2 ballot for FHIR R4. As such, the scope of this second ballot for the R4 cycle is limited to the changes 
made from the 2018-May ballot cycle. Feedback not related to changes made will most likely be found "not related" and/or deferred to consideration as part of R5.
</p>
<p>
To assist balloters, for the Normative ballot, each substantitive change made is listed, along with links to the 
page and the task that prompted the change. Also, diff links are provided to assist with reviewing the non-substantitive
changes. 
</p>
<p>
For the Trial-Use ballot, the significant new content areas or changes are indicated.
</p>

<a name="maps"></a>
<p>
The specification has been updated to include R3/R4 maps and difference analysis, but 
these have not been updated. This will be done proper to publication of the final 
specification. In the meantime, balloters are welcome to comment on suggested 
improvements to the mappings and difference statements, but these cannot be the 
basis for negative votes. Contributions may also be made directly 
(join the <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/133-R3.2FR4-Conversion.20work">conversation at chat.fhir.org</a>).
</p>

<a name="diffs"></a>
<p>
The lists below provide 2 "diff" links - these are links that ask a W3C differencing engine to compare the 2 pages of the specification. There are two different types of link:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a no-external="true" style="border: 1px solid lightgrey; white-space: nowrap; background-color: #FBF8D5; padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px" href="#self" title="Difference to R3">ΔR</a>: Difference analysis from R3 (last full release)</li>
 <li><a no-external="true" style="border: 1px solid lightgrey; white-space: nowrap; background-color: #EDFDFE; padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px" href="#self" title="Difference to last ballot">ΔB</a>: Difference analysis from the first normative ballot</li>
</ul>
<p>
The W3C differencing engine is the best free html diff engine that we know of, but does have issues. In particular, when reviewing differences 
for resources and types, the special presentation forms (tables, svg) which are rich in rendering metadata makes the difference analysis a little
confusing or even unreliable in places. Reviewers will find it easier to looks the differences for the definitions rather that the tables 
structures - e.g. when reviewing based on the diffs, review the definitions page changes first.
