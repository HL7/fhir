<p>
Welcome to the draft ballot for FHIR Release 5 (R5) ballot. 
The R5 release of FHIR has content with different ballot statuses: 
</p>
<ul>
 <li><span style="background-color: #e6ffe6; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Normative</b></span>: Content that is subject to normative ballot rules. Once passed, <a href="versions.html#change">strict rules</a> are imposed on future change to help ensure inter-version compatibility</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #fff5e6; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Trial Use</b></span>: Content that is undergoing <a href="versions.html#maturity">FHIR maturity Model</a> based testing. In a future ballot cycle, once sufficiently mature, it will be balloted as normative</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #ffffe6; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Informative</b></span>: Content that is advisory (e.g. implementers are not required to conform to the content), or navigational content - tables of contents, generated lists, etc.</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #efefef; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Draft</b></span>: Content added late in the balloting process that has no formal standing, but is published for visibility. It might not be suitable for use in production systems.</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #ffcccc; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Deprecated</b></span>: Content that is in the process of being removed (see <a href="versions.html#deprecation">deprecation</a>).</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #e6ffff; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>External</b></span>: Content that is replicated from external standards (e.g. HL7 v2, DICOM) and is not subject to ballot comment. This content is mostly being moved out of the specification now</li>
</ul>

<h3>The FHIR R5 Ballot Process</h3>

<p>
This is the first step in the FHIR R5 Ballot Process. The draft ballot is the start of the ovrall ballot process for 
FHIR R5. The intent is to allow the various committees that maintain content to get comments on the overall 
direction and scope of their content, and to exercise new and updated publishing and voting machinery.
</p>
<p>
Three ballot periods are anticipated:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr>
   <td>Draft Ballot</td>
   <td>Apr - May 2021</td>
   <td>This ballot</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Ballot #1</td>
   <td>Aug - Sept 2021</td>
   <td>The first full R5 ballot, both Normative and Trial Use content, split into multiple ballot packages (the exact details are yet to be resolved)</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><b>Follow up Ballot</b></td>
   <td>Dec - Jan 2021</td>
   <td><b>If necessary:</b> Reballoting of normative content where required, and significant new or revised Trial Use content</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
This ballot introduces a number of significant changes that are part of the Release 5:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finish removing content moved to http://terminology.hl7.org</li>
  <li>Rework the abstact datatypes (new types <a href="types.html#Base">Base</a>, <a href="types.html#DataType">DataType</a>, <a href="types.html#BackboneType">BackboneType</a>), 
      and introduce <a href="canonicalresource.html">CanonicalResource</a> and <a href="metadataresource.html">MetadataResource</a> interfaces</li>
  <li>Major upgrade to <a href="subscription.html">Subscription</a> resource and the pub/sub patterns</li>
  <li>Add <a href="datatypes.html#integer64">integer64</a>, <a href="references.html#CodeableReference">CodeableReference</a>, <a href="datatypes.html#RatioRange">RatioRange</a> datatypes
 and new resources <a href="inventoryreport.html">InventoryReport</a>,
      <a href="citation.html">Citation</a>, <a href="permission.html">Permission</a>, <a href="nutritionproduct.html">NutritionProduct</a>, and <a href="evidencereport.html">EvidenceReport</a>, ClinicalUseIssue</li>
  <li>Major work on <a href="medication-definition-module.html">medication definitions</a>, and <a href="evidence.html">evidence based medicine</a></li>
  <li>In addition, there have been changes across many of the resources based on implementer feedback, including to normative resources; these changes are not summarised here</li>
</ul>

<h3>Balloting Process</h3>

<p>
This ballot is using HL7's new <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Jira+Ballot+Process">Jira balloting process</a>. As such, ballot comments will need to 
be submitted in Jira and, in general, balloting spreadsheets will not be used. Some organizational 
and affiliate balloters may continue to use spreadsheets but will be responsible for importing 
them into Jira themselves and may have slightly different processes for consolidating ballots 
to take that into account. The ballot desktop will be used for voter registration but will 
not be available for vote submission. Voters are encouraged to view the <a href="https://youtu.be/Qb-02MWgugM">recorded tutorial</a>
on Jira balloting in addition to reading through the instructions on <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Specification+Feedback">submitting Jira feedback</a>
and <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Jira+Ballot+Process">using Jira balloting</a>. 
A webinar will be held part-way through the ballot cycle to provide an opportunity to ask questions about the process. Questions can also be raised on the 
<a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/184932-JIRA.2FConfluence">Jira/Confluence  stream</a> on <code>http://chat.fhir.org</code>.
</p>
<p>
Because this is only an draft ballot, committees are not required to response to comment, but will endeavour to do so.
</p>
<p>
When submitting your ballot feedback, if you have a general comment on something that you see occurring multiple times, please include 
at least a couple of specific locations where you see the issue.  As much as possible, capture each separate concern as a distinct 
<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir-issues">tracker item</a>; it makes our job of reconciling much easier.  Also, don't forget to 
fill in the section numbers (gray numbers to the left of each heading) and URLs.  Only one URL should be placed in the "url" element or column.  
If you want to reference additional URLs, include them in the text of your ballot comment.
</p>
<p>
If you have questions that are interfering with the ability to review the specification or submit ballot comments, please contact one of 
the co-chairs of the FHIR Management Group: <a href="mailto:lloyd@lmckenzie.com">Lloyd McKenzie</a> or 
<a href="mailto:david.hay25@gmail.com">David Hay</a>.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for taking the time to review the FHIR specification.  We appreciate any feedback you can provide.
</p>

<p>
The difference analysis in this ballot for resources is still between Release 3 and Release 4. This will be updated
when Release 5 is prior to publication of the final specification. In the meantime, balloters are welcome to comment on suggested 
improvements to the mappings and difference statements, but these cannot be the 
basis for negative votes. Contributions may also be made directly 
(join the <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/133-R3.2FR4-Conversion.20work">conversation at chat.fhir.org</a>).
