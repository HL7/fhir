<p>
Welcome to the FHIR Release 6 (R6) 3rd ballot. 
</p>
<p>
This ballot is the third ballot of R6, and the last of the draft ballots; the next
ballot (expected in the January 2026 cycle) is the full mixed normative/trial use ballot.
</p>
<p>
While comment is welcome on all of the content, we are particularly interested in 
comments addressing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Structural changes needed prior to finalization</li>
  <li>the readiness of the content for the upcoming full ballot, and</li> 
  <li>comments that relate to maturity levels and readiness for Normative</li> 
</ul>
<p>
In addition, Balloters attention is drawn to the following areas of interest:
</p>

Beyond this, almost all the less mature resources have extensive changes, but there are many 
thousands of individual changes. At this time, the version comparison functionality is not
working; we are endeavouring to have this functional by the time the ballot opens.

<h3>The FHIR R6 Ballot Process</h3>

<p>
This is the third of a series of draft ballots on R6, where different candidate resources for normative 
status in the final R6 version undergo focused review in order to try and reduce the overall ballot load
of the final R6 ballot. 
</p>

<p>
Balloter's attention is drawn to two useful links at the bottom of every page: <img src="compare-links-r5-ballot.png"/>.
These are very useful when preparing ballot comments.
</p>
<p>
This ballot is using HL7's <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Jira+Ballot+Process">Jira balloting process</a>. As such, ballot comments will need to 
be submitted in Jira and, in general, balloting spreadsheets will not be used. Some organizational 
and affiliate balloters may continue to use spreadsheets but will be responsible for importing 
them into Jira themselves and may have slightly different processes for consolidating ballots 
to take that into account. The ballot desktop will be used for voter registration but will 
not be available for vote submission. Voters are encouraged to view the <a href="https://youtu.be/Qb-02MWgugM">recorded tutorial</a>
on Jira balloting in addition to reading through the instructions on <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Specification+Feedback">submitting Jira feedback</a>
and <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Jira+Ballot+Process">using Jira balloting</a>. 
A webinar will be held part-way through the ballot cycle to provide an opportunity to ask questions about the process. Questions can also be raised on the 
<a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/184932-JIRA.2FConfluence">Jira/Confluence  stream</a> on <code>http://chat.fhir.org</code>.
</p>
<p>
Because this is only a draft ballot, committees are not required to response to comment, but will endeavour to do so.
</p>
<p>
When submitting your ballot feedback, if you have a general comment on something that you see occurring multiple times, please include 
at least a couple of specific locations where you see the issue.  As much as possible, capture each separate concern as a distinct 
<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir-issues">tracker item</a>; it makes our job of reconciling much easier.  Also, don't forget to 
fill in the section numbers (gray numbers to the left of each heading) and URLs.  Only one URL should be placed in the "url" element or column.  
If you want to reference additional URLs, include them in the text of your ballot comment.
</p>
<p>
If you have questions that are interfering with the ability to review the specification or submit ballot comments, please contact one of 
the co-chairs of the FHIR Management Group: <a href="mailto:lloyd@lmckenzie.com">Lloyd McKenzie</a> or 
<a href="mailto:david.hay25@gmail.com">David Hay</a>.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for taking the time to review the FHIR specification.  We appreciate any feedback you can provide.
</p>

<p>
The difference analysis in this ballot for resources is still between Release 5 and Release 4. This will be updated
when Release 6 is prior to publication of the final specification. In the meantime, balloters are welcome to comment on suggested 
improvements to the mappings and difference statements, but these cannot be the 
basis for negative votes. Contributions may also be made directly 
(join the <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/133-R3.2FR4-Conversion.20work">conversation at chat.fhir.org</a>).
