<h2>STU 3 Ballot Welcome</h2>

<p>
Hello and welcome to the third FHIR STU ballot!
</p>
<p>
This specification represents a series of significant changes and enhancements from the second FHIR Draft Standard for Trial Use
specification HL7 published in October, 2015.  It also includes changes resulting from committee meetings, connectathons, 1000's of  
change proposals, and collaborations with other standards organizations.  A <a href="history.html#v1.6.0">summary of change</a>  
and a <a href="diff.html">complete list of changes to resources and data types</a> are available.
</p>
<p>
FHIR is presently a "Specification for Trial Use" (STU) ballot. FHIR is no longer a "Draft" specification.
Indeed, there are many implementations in production all across the world, or in preparation for production 
adoption. There are still some parts of the specification in an early stage of development, while other parts 
are quite mature and stable. In fact, as of this version, most DSTU 2 patient resources are still valid STU 3 
Patient resources, though this is not a requirement - yet. We anticipate that some content will become 
normative on the next ballot after this one. For full details concerning the maturity process in the FHIR 
specification, see the <a href="resource.html#maturity">FHIR maturity Model</a>.
</p>
<p>
The FHIR specification is presented as a series of interlinked HTML pages.  They can either be reviewed online or can be
<a href="fhir-spec.zip">downloaded</a> for exploration on your own device.  (175MB zip, ~1GB unzipped). The scope of
the FHIR Ballot is any page where the URL starts with http://hl7.org/fhir/2016Sep. 
</p>
<p>
A few notes to consider:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pay close attention to the FMM level of the artifacts (as described above)</li>
  <li>Not all of the existing outstanding issues will be resolved prior to the STU ballot passing.  Some may be left open to allow feedback 
  from the early adopter community.</li>
  <li>This specification is complete enough to be implementable in a variety of healthcare scenarios, including supporting the "Common 
  Meaningful Use Data Set" and other content from the Consolidated CDA implementation guide.  However, the set 
  of resources is not complete.  Resources may evolve and new ones will be introduced over time.  Refer to <a href="timelines.html">FHIR 
  Timelines</a> for additional guidance on expectations around the evolution of the FHIR specification, or the road maps on the module pages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Balloting Rules</h3>
<p>
HL7 ballot rules require that participants sign up prior to opening of the ballot.  If you did not sign up in advance, you
can still submit comments using the <a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemAdd&amp;tracker_id=677">Propose a Change</a>
link at the bottom of each page of the specification.  Feedback from balloters will be given priority, but all suggestions will be
considered as much as time allows.  (And be sure to <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_email_list_subscription_instructions">sign up</a> 
to the FHIR list-server and/or follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fhir">#FHIR</a> hash-tag so you don't miss the chance to 
vote in the next ballot cycle.)
</p>
<p>
If you are signed up to ballot, you can download the balloting spreadsheet from the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/participate/onlineballoting.cfm">Ballot Desktop</a>.
All ballot feedback must be provided using the spreadsheet template provided.  (There's a help tab that explains the meaning of each of the columns.)
For FHIR, you have the option of making your comments directly in the spreadsheet or submitting your comment using the FHIR
<a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemBrowse">Change Tracker</a> tool.  If you take the latter approach, you <b>must</b> include a reference to each tracker item in your
ballot spreadsheet along with a vote (negative, affirmative typo, etc.).  All spreadsheets must be submitted along with an overall vote
by end of day Eastern time on the designated ballot closure date for the comments to be considered as part of ballot disposition.
</p>
<p>
Note: By using the tracker, you reduce some of the administrative effort of managing the ballot process.  As well, you will receive notifications
when comments are made on your ballot comment as well as when dispositions are made.  Comments not submitted to the tracker as part of the ballot
process will be migrated to the tracker after all ballot submissions are received.
</p>
<p>
When submitting your ballot feedback, if you have a general comment on something that you see occurring multiple times, please include 
at least a couple of specific locations where you see the issue.  As much as possible, capture each separate concern as a distinct row 
in the ballot sheet or separate <a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemBrowse">tracker item</a>.  (If using tracker items for your submissions, you <b>MUST</b> still
submit a ballot spreadsheet referencing the relevant tracker items.)  It makes our job of reconciling much easier.  Also, don't forget to 
fill in the section numbers (gray numbers to the left of each heading) and URLs.
</p>
<p>
If you have questions that are interfering with the ability to review the specification or submit ballot comments, please contact one of 
the co-chairs of the FHIR Management Group: <a href="mailto:lloyd@lmckenzie.com">Lloyd McKenzie</a> or 
<a href="mailto:david.hay25@gmail.com">David Hay</a>.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for taking the time to review the FHIR specification.  We appreciate any feedback you can provide.
