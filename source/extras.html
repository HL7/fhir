<h3>Compartments</h3>
<p>
Each resource may belong to one or more logical compartments. A compartment is a logical 
grouping of resources which share a common property. Compartments have two principal roles:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Function as an access mechanism for finding a set of related resources quickly</li>
 <li>Provide a definitional basis for applying access control to resources quickly</li>
</ul>
<p>
Compartment definitions describe how particular compartment instances are named and identified,
and how systems know which resources are in the compartment. The following compartments are 
defined by this specification:
</p>
<%compartmentlist%>
<p>
As an example of compartment usage, to retrieve a list of a patient's conditions, use the URL:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [base]/Patient/[id]/Condition
</pre>
<p>
The details of this usage are <a href="http.html#search">described under the search operation</a>.
As a search related operation, the assignment of resources to compartments is only based on 
the current version of any of the resources involved. Note that <a href="references.html#contained">contained</a>
patient resources cannot create a patient compartment of their own. 
</p>
<p>
Compartments may be used explicitly, like this, but can also be used implicitly. For instance,
if a FHIR server is providing a patient view of a record, the authorized user associated
with use of the FHIR RESTful API may be limited to accessing records from the
compartment instance(s) logically associated with their identity. Irrespective of whether
compartments are being used explicitly or implicitly, servers will need to make arrangements
to make some resources with no direct link to a patient available to the client (medications, 
substances, etc.).
</p>
<p>
Note that resources may cross between compartments, or interlink them. Examples of 
this would be where a <a href="diagnosticreport.html">Diagnostic Report</a> identifies  
a subject, but an <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> it references identifies
a different subject, or where a <a href="list.html">List</a> resource references
items that identify different subjects. Such cross-linking may arise for 
many valid reasons, including:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Cases where subject records are inter-linked - Transplants, Perinatal care, family therapy etc.</li>
 <li>Workflow management where action lists link multiple patients and/or practitioners</li>
</ul>
<p>
Given the wide variety of use cases and contexts in which FHIR is used, compartments 
do not define how cross-linking is handled. Systems may reject resources, remove them 
from both compartments, or place them in both, or act in some other fashion.
