<h2>Tags, Bundles, Compartments and Binary Resources</h2>

<a name="tag"> </a>
<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>
In addition to the basic contents of resources and their metadata, each resource can be labelled
with one or more "Tags". These tags can be used to associate additional operational information 
with the Resources, including <!-- defining security labels used to support access control policies, -->
identifying bundles, workflow management and claiming that resources conform to <a href="profile.html">profiles</a>. 
Tags are attached to resources and exchanged with the resource. Tags are never used to keep information 
that needs to be understood when interpreting the content of a resource; their function is limited to finding 
and controlling access to the resource, and connecting resources to technical or clinical workflow.
</p>
<p>
Each tag has three properties:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 http://hl7.org/fhir/tag
 <tr><td>Scheme : uri</td><td>A uri that identifies the type of the tag</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Term : uri</td><td>An absolute URI which defines the meaning of the tag</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Label : string</td><td>(Optional) A human-readable label for the tag for use when displaying in end-user applications</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The following tag schemes are defined:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>http://hl7.org/fhir/tag</td><td>A general tag</td></tr>
 <tr><td>http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/profile</td><td>A profile tag - a claim that the Resource conforms to the profile identified in the term</td></tr>
 <tr><td>http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/security</td><td><a href="security.html#labels">A security label</a></td></tr>
</table>

<h4>General Tags</h4>
<p>
In a general tag, the term may be a reference to a healthcare vocabulary, including ones defined 
in this specification, and vocabularies such as those defined by HL7 (v2 and v3/CDA), LOINC, or 
SNOMED CT. Alternatively, the term may be one defined by the implementation in the local context. 
Literal references that refer directly to a description of the tag (typically just 
an HTML page) are preferred over symbolic references but this is not required.
</p>
<p>
If the end user application provides functionality to the user that allows the user to 
affix arbitrary text tags to the resource for their own purpose, the application can 
automatically construct a term by appending the Url encoded Label to the base
URL "http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/text/". When applications processing resources see this
base URL, they can automatically know that this is a pure text label with no formal
meaning.
</p>
<b>Known General Tags</b>
<p>
This table summarizes the tags that are defined as part of this specification:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr> <td><b>Term</b></td> <td><b>Context</b></td> <td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
 <tr> <td>http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/document</td> <td>A bundle (feed.category)</td> <td>Identifies that this bundle represents <a href="documents.html">a document</a></td></tr>
 <tr> <td>http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/message</td> <td>A bundle (feed.category)</td> <td>Identifies that this bundle represents <a href="messaging.html">a message</a></td></tr>
</table>

<a name="profile-tags"> </a>
<h4>Profile Tags</h4>
<p>
A profile tag is an assertion that the resource conforms to a particular 
<a href="profile.html">Profile</a>, which are sets of rules about what 
content is allowed to be in a resource. In a profile tag, the term
is a URL that references a profile resource.
</p>
<p>
It's always possible to determine whether a resource conforms to a 
profile simply by testing it against the profile (the <a href="downloads.html">validation tools</a>
provide the functionality to perform this test in a variety of contexts). 
However there are several circumstances where simply examining whether 
a resource conforms to a particular profile as needed is impractical:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A server searching a set of resources for ones that conform to a particular profile</li>
 <li>A receiver that has many profiles to choose when validating resource</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, a validation application (see <a href="http.html#validation">RESTful validation</a>) needs
a way for the client to inform it that it wants the resource tested against as a particular profile. 
</p>
<p>
Profile Tags serve these use cases - a client/creator of a resource can tag the 
resource with an assertion that the resource conforms to a profile. The server/receiver
of the resource can choose to take this assertion at face value, or to assist in locating
the profile against which to validate the resource. 
</p>
<p>
Note: resources can conform to multiple profiles at once. A resource can conform to 
a profile without ever being labelled that it does, or a resource may falsely claim to conform 
to a profile. For this reason, applications processing resources SHOULD always 
depend on the contents of the resource when processing them, and/or check resources
against profiles directly rather than relying on profile tags.
Profile Tags are provided as a method of finding resources that conform to 
a particular profile, not statements of meaning about the resource.

<h3>Compartments</h3>
<p>
Each resource may belong to one or more logical compartments. A compartment is a logical 
grouping of resources which share a common property. Compartments have two principal roles:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Function as an access mechanism for finding a set of related resources quickly</li>
 <li>Provide a definitional basis for applying access control to resources quickly</li>
</ul>
<p>
Compartment definitions describe how particular compartment instances are named and identified,
and how systems know which resources are in the compartment. The following compartments are 
defined by this specification:
</p>
<%compartmentlist%>
<p>
As an example of compartment usage, to retrieve a list of a patient's conditions, use the URL:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [baseurl]/Patient/[id]/condition
</pre>
<p>
The details of this usage are <a href="http.html#search">described under the search operation</a>.
As a search related operation, the assignment of resources to compartments is only based on 
the current version of any of the resources involved. Note that <a href="references.html#contained">contained</a>
patient resources cannot create a patient compartment of their own. 
</p>
<p>
Compartments may be used explicitly, like this, but can also be used implicitly. For instance,
if a FHIR server is providing a patient view of a record, the authorized user associated
with use of the FHIR RESTful API may be limited to accessing records from the
compartment instance(s) logically associated with their identity. Irrespective of whether
compartments are being used explicitly or implicitly, servers will need to make arrangements
to make some resources with no direct link to a patient available to the client (medications, 
substances, etc.).
</p>
<p>
Note that resources may cross between compartments, or interlink them. Examples of 
this would be where a <a href="diagnosticreport.html">Diagnostic Report</a> identifies  
a subject, but an <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> it references identifies
a different subject, or where a <a href="list.html">List</a> resource references
items that identify different subjects. Such cross-linking may arise for 
many valid reasons, including:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Cases where subject records are inter-linked - Transplants, Perinatal care, family therapy etc.</li>
 <li>Workflow management where action lists link multiple patients and/or practitioners</li>
</ul>
<p>
Given the wide variety of use cases and contexts in which FHIR is used, compartments 
do not define how cross-linking is handled. Systems may reject resources, remove them 
from both compartments, or place them in both, or act in some other fashion.

<h3>Resource Bundles</h3>
<p>
One common operation performed with resources is to gather a collection of resources into a single instance
with containing context.
In FHIR this is referred to as "bundling" the resources together. The resource bundle 
mostly includes the whole content of a resource, not just their metadata and their reference. 
These resource bundles are useful for a variety of different reasons, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Returning a set of resources that meet some criteria as part of a server operation (see <a href="http.html#search">RESTful Search</a>)</li>
  <li>Returning a set of versions of resources as part of the history operation on a server  (see <a href="http.html#history">History</a>)</li>
  <li>Exchanging a set of resources as part of a message transaction (see <a href="messaging.html">Messaging</a>)</li>
  <li>Grouping a self-contained set of resources to act as an exchangeable and persistable group with clinical integrity - a clinical document (see <a href="documents.html">Documents</a>)</li>
  <li>Storing a collection of resources</li>
</ul>
<p>
The content of bundled resources SHALL always be present except in the special case of a transaction response.
</p>
<p>
Conceptually, a bundle has an identifier (url) and a date updated, and a list of resources, each of 
which  has its metadata as listed above. Also, both the bundle and each resource have a set of 
named links, and may have additional <a href="#tags">Tags</a> that indicate what use the bundle 
has. 
</p>
<p>
Applications reading
the bundle <a href="references.html#atom-refs">should always look for a resource by its identity (after converting relative URLs
absolute URL) in the bundle first</a> before trying to access it by its URL.
</p>
<p>
In XML, a bundle is represented as an <a href="xml.html#atom">Atom Feed</a>, and in JSON, a <a href="json.html#bundle">custom format</a> is defined.
</p>

<a name="binary"></a> 
<a name="Binary"></a> 
<h3>Binary Resources</h3>
<p>
There are situations where it is useful or required to handle pure binary content using the 
same framework as other resources. Typically, this is when the binary content is referred to from 
other FHIR Resources. Using the same framework means that the existing servers, security arrangements,
code libraries etc. can handle additional related content. Typically, Binary resources are used 
for handling content such as:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>CDA Documents (i.e. with XDS)</li>
 <li>PDF Documents</li>
 <li>Images (the Media resource is preferred for handling images, but not possible when the content is already binary - XDS) </li>
</ul>
<p>
A binary resource can contain any content, whether text, image, pdf, zip archive, etc. 
These resources are served in their native form on the rest interface, but can also be represented 
in XML or JSON, such as when including these resources in a bundle (used when it is convenient to 
include these in the feed directly rather than leaving them by reference).
