<p>
This specification is a common platform standard that must be <a href="profiling.html">adapted to particular
use cases</a>. 

Some particular use cases are common or important enough to be described as a part of the 
specification itself. These are published as groups of <a href="structuredefinition.html">Structure Definitions</a> (profiles or extensions),
which are often found in implementation guides, along with <a href="valueset.html">Value Sets</a>, 
newly defined <a href="searchparameter.html">search parameters</a> and examples that are all defined with a common purpose. 
Additional profiles and extensions may be registered on the HL7 FHIR registry at <a href="http://registry.fhir.org">http://registry.fhir.org</a>
