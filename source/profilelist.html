<h2>Profiles defined as part of FHIR</h2>
 
<p>
A <a href="profile.html">Profile</a> is a special resource that provides additional rules 
about how a type of resource is utilized in a particular context of use, or for a particular use
case. 
</p>
<p>
Some particular use cases are common or important enough to be described as a part of the 
specification itself:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr>
  <td><b>Name</b></td>
  <td><b>Usage</b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><a href="general-extensions.html">General Extensions</a></td>
  <td>A set of general extensions defined for the convenience of implementers that use FHIR resources</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><a href="us-core.html">US Profile</a></td>
  <td>Contains constraints and extensions to the FHIR specification specific to the US realm</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><a href="iso-21090.html">ISO 21090</a></td>
  <td>Extra ISO 21090 features not included in data types because of core design policy</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><a href="questionnaire-extensions.html">Questionnaire</a></td>
  <td>Core extensions for Questionnaire</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><a href="tools-extensions.html">Tools Extensions</a></td>
  <td>Extensions defined by the build tools. These extensions are candidates for being elevated into the core in a subsequent version</td>
 </tr>
</table>
