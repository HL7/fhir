<h2>MeasureReport Search</h2>
<p>Although the MeasureReport resource does define search parameters, it is up to the individual measure evaluation service whether or not historical records of measure evaluation requests are preserved. A service may not support searching on MeasureReports at all, or it may support searching only for a pre-defined expiration period. The search parameters are defined to provide consumers with a consistent interface to searching if it is available for a specific service implementation. In any case, services should detail the support they do provide using a CapabilityStatement.</p>
