<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
The Permission resource is intended to be used where <a href="consent.html">Consent</a> resource does not apply or where exposure of the full <a href="consent.html">Consent</a> details are not needed or desired.
The Permission resource may be used to express transactional access control rules that may be derived from a <a href="consent.html">Consent</a>.
The Permission resource is intended to be used when access control policy rules need to be expressed in an interoperable way other than <a href="consent.html">Consent</a>. 
Examples are use-cases that are not involving a patient subject.
The Permission resource should not be used in a conflicting way with <a href="security-labels.html">security labels in the .meta.security element</a>.
