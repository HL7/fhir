Appointment resources are used to provide information about 
a meeting that may be in the future or past. An adverse sensitivity is defined as:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  A condition expected to result in undesirable physiologic reaction to an 
  amount of a substance that would not produce a reaction in most individuals.  
  The substance is the trigger of an immunologic response that produces the 
  observed physiologic changes, or in some instances nonimmunologic mechanisms 
  that produce clinically identical physiologic changes.  The immunologic 
  response might be considered the actual cause of the reaction, but it is 
  exposure to the trigger substance that is clinically observable.
  </p>  
</blockquote>  
<p>
This definition excludes clinically identical episodes that may be caused by 
physical agents, such as heat, cold, sunlight, or vibration, by exercise activity, 
or by infectious agents. Those conditions caused by physical agents or infectious 
would be captured on the problem list (<a href="list.html">List</a>/<a href="condition.html">Condition</a> Resources). The allergy/intolerance list is a list of 
conditions that represent a propensity unique to this individual for 
a reaction upon future exposure to a specified substance.
