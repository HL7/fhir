		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p>
			Appointment resources are used to provide information about
			a planned meeting that may be in the future or past.  They may be for a single meeting or
			for a series of repeating visits.  Examples include a scheduled surgery, a follow-up for a
			clinical visit, a scheduled conference call between clinicians to discuss a case, the reservation
			of a piece of diagnostic equipment for a particular use, etc.  The visit scheduled by an appointment
			may be in person or remote (by phone, video conference, etc.)  All that matters is that the time and
			usage of one or more individuals, locations and/or pieces of equipment is being fully or partially
			reserved for a designated period of time.
		</p>
		<p>
			This definition takes the concepts of appointments in a clinical setting and also extends
			them to be relevant in the community healthcare space, and also ease exposure to other
			appointment / calendar standards widely used outside of Healthcare.

		<h3>The basic workflow to create an appointment</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h4>Discovery/Addressing</h4>
				<p>
					The discovery process covers that actual finding of the resource that we want to schedule
					an appointment with. This includes the addressing information that is required, and any
					formatting information which indicates how to make the request.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Checking Availability (optional)</h4>
				<p>
					This optional step permits the checking of any existing available times that can be booked against.
					Just because a time is indicated it is available doesn't guarantee that an appointment can be made.
					The booking system that is going to receive the request may make other qualifying decisions to
					determine if the appointment can be made, such as permissions, assessments, availability of other
					resources etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					This step is optional as the creation of the appointment is never a guaranteed action.
					But by performing this availability check, you can increase the chances of making a successful
					booking.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Making the Appointment Request</h4>
				<p>
					The request is performed by posting an Appointment to the address found during discovery.
					This will have a needs-action status for each of the participants.
					(The system that receives the request may modify the status of any posted appointment based
					on internal business rules, such as certain users do not have permission to request certain
					appointments)
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Replying to the request</h4>
				<p>
					The reply process is simply performed by the person/system handing the requests updating
					the Participant Statuses as needed. If there are multiple systems involved, then these
					will create AppointmentResponse entries with the desired statuses.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once all participants have their participation status created/updated
					(and the main system marking the appointment participant records with the AppointmentResponse
					statuses) then the overall status of the appointment is updated.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Checking the overall status (Requester)</h4>
				<p>
					The Requester (organizer) of the appointment checks for the overall status of the appointment
					(and appointmentresponses where applicable) using fhir pub-sub techniques.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where the participant statuses indicate that a re-scheduling is required, then the process may
					start again, with other systems replying to a new set of times.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>There are 2 typical workflows that occur with appointments</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Outlook Style - Community</b>
				<p>These types of requests are typically handled by selecting a specific time</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Hospital Scheduling - Clinical</b>
				<p></p>
			</li>
