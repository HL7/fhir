		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p>
			Appointment resources are used to provide information about
			a planned meeting that may be in the future or past. The resource only describes a single meeting,
			a series of repeating visits would require multiple appointment resources to be created for each instance.
			Examples include a scheduled surgery, a follow-up for a
			clinical visit, a scheduled conference call between clinicians to discuss a case (where the patient is a subject, but not a participant), the reservation
			of a piece of diagnostic equipment for a particular use, etc.
			The visit scheduled by an appointment
			may be in person or remote (by phone, video conference, etc.)  All that matters is that the time and
			usage of one or more individuals, locations and/or pieces of equipment is being fully or partially
			reserved for a designated period of time.
		</p>
		<p>
			This definition takes the concepts of appointments in a clinical setting and also extends
			them to be relevant in the community healthcare space, and to ease exposure to other
			appointment / calendar standards widely used outside of healthcare.

    <h3>The basic workflow to create an appointment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Discovery/Addressing</b>
				<p>
					Before an appointment can be made, the address/endpoint details of the resource that we want 
					to schedule an appointment with must be determined. This is often based on the healthcare service type
					and any formatting information which indicates how to make the request.
					This is typically handled via the Schedule resource.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Checking Availability on the Schedule (optional)</b>
				<p>
					This optional step permits the checking of any existing available times 
					(<a href="slot.html">Slot</a> resources associated with a selected <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a>) that can be booked against.
					Just because a time is indicated as available doesn't guarantee that an appointment can be made.
					The booking system that is going to process the request may make other qualifying decisions to
					determine if the appointment can be made, such as permissions, assessments, availability of other
					resources, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					This step is optional, as the creation of the appointment is never a guaranteed action.
					But by performing this availability check, you can increase the chances of making a successful
					booking.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Making the Appointment Request</b>
				<p>
					When an appointment is required, a requester creates new Appointment resource with the Appointment.status="proposed".<br/>
					All included participants (optional or mandatory) should have the status="needs-action" to allow filtering and displaying
					appointments to user-participants for accepting or rejecting new and updated requests. Based on internal system business rules,
					certain statuses may be automatically updated, for example: "reject because the requested participant is on vacation" or 
					"this type of user is not allowed to request those specific appointments".
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Replying to the request</b>
				<p>
					The reply process is simply performed by the person/system handling the requests, updating
					the participant statuses on the appointment as needed. If there are multiple systems involved, then these
					will create AppointmentResponse entries with the desired statuses.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once all participants have their participation status created/updated
					(and the main system marking the appointment participant records with the AppointmentResponse
					statuses) then the overall status of the Appointment is updated.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Checking the overall status (Requester)</b>
				<p>
					The requester (organizer) of the appointment checks for the overall status of the appointment
					(and appointment responses, where applicable) using FHIR pub-sub techniques.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where the participant statuses indicate that a re-scheduling is required, then the process may
					start again, with other systems replying to a new set of times.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Waitlisting the Appointment (optional)</b>
				<p>
					This optional step permits creating a waitlisted appointment. This could occur if an
					appointment needs to be booked into a time that is not ideal for the patient due to lack of available
					time slots.  In this workflow, there would be two appointments, the booked appointment in the time 
					slot that is currently available, and the waitlisted appointment with a requestedPeriod spanning the
					time that the patient would prefer if new slots become available.
				</p>
				<p>				
					If new time slots become available during the requestedPeriod, the scheduling system, or staff
					at the scheduling organization, can notify the patient that a new time slot is available.  If the patient
					chooses, the waitlisted appointment would then be booked into that specific slot, and the previously booked 
					appointment would be canceled.  The specific business process for notifying patients of new availability is not
					specified, and is up to the implementing system to determine.					
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

<a name="workflow-types"></a>
		<h3>There are 2 typical workflows that occur with appointments</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Outlook Style - Community</b>
				<p>
					These types of requests are typically handled by selecting a specific time from a list of available slots,
					then making the request for that timeslot.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Hospital Scheduling - Clinical</b>
				<p>
					Clinical scheduling is often far more complex in its requirements and processing.
					Often this involves checking multiple availabilities across multiple systems and
					timing with other internal systems, not just those exposed by the Slot resources.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consideration should be given to situations where scheduling needs to be handled
					in more of a queue-like process.
				</p>

	<h3>Recurring Appointments</h3>
	<p>
		There are 2 main forms of recurring appointments recognized by FHIR:
		<ul>
			<li>(recurring) Regular meetings which occur based on a template, usually pre-allocated with a well defined frequency and a set purpose</li>
			<li>(series) An appointment that has a series of follow up appointments which are more adhoc/irregular in nature<br/>
				This type does not typically pre-allocate bookings, but are re-booked each time based on loose guidance.
				These could also have different services on each re-booking (potentially via a protocol)
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h4>Recurring (template/pattern)</h4>
	<p>
		The recurring appointment uses the <code>recurrenceTemplate</code> property to define when all of the occurrences
		of the appointment should occur. This value only exists on the original booking for the appointment, for all the 
		subsequent occurrences the <code>originatingAppointment</code> refers back to original for the template details.
	</p>
	<p>
		Accepting a recurring appointment can be done either as accepting the entire series 
		(using <code>AppointmentRequest.recurring=true</code>) or can accept each occurrence individually
		(using <code>AppointmentRequest.recurring=false</code> along with <code>AppointmentRequest.occurrenceDate</code>
		or <code>AppointmentRequest.recurrenceId</code> to indicate which repitition specifically)
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that in the template the <code>timezone</code> property defines which timezone the start/end times
		apply. This is required as the <code>time</code> properties only have the offset (+10), and not the zone (Australia/Melbourne), which means
		that they cannot be used by the template to generate 9am every Wednesday all year (as Melbourne changes to +11 during daylight saving time).<br/>
		</p>
	
	<h4>Series (simple chain)</h4>
	<p>
		A series appointment has no template information, and thus don't use the 
		<code>recurrenceTemplate</code> property. Often when first booked it is likely not known
		that it will become a series of bookings, and only on conclusion of the encounter it is decided to follow-up
		and then book a new appointment (or even book it later on) and relate the new booking to the previous in the series
		through the <code>previousAppointment</code> property.
		This style of recurring appointment likely won't use the <code>originatingAppointment</code> property either.
	</p>
	<p>
		As each appointment in a series is a separate appointment and booked as needed, the acceptance of requests here is
		just as it would be normally if they didn't have a sequence.
	</p>
	<p>
		As each occurrence is booked independently there are no specific issues with timezones, as each instance exactly
		defines when it occurs (there is no template).
	</p>

	[%stu-note%]
		<b>Note:</b>  We are seeking input from the implementer community on the recurring appointment functionality
		and specifically if there is a need for a "recur forever" or similar flag.

    <h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
		<h3>Appointment Request/Response Pattern</h3>
		<p>
			When using a request-response style of appointment this is done using Appointment 
			and AppointmentResponse resources.<br/>
			The request is made in the form of an Appointment with a proposed or pending status,
			and the list of actors with a participation status of "needs-action".
		</p>
		<p>
			Participants in the appointment respond with their acceptance (or not) to the appointment
			by creating AppointmentResponse resources.<br/>
			Once all the participants have replied, then the Appointment resource is able to be
			updated with an overall status which collates the results of all the participants
			and presents the approved details of the appointment.
		</p>
		<p>
			The participant type property can be used to represent a specific role that a practitioner 
			is required to perform for the appointment. This could be specified without an actor when the actual
			practitioner is not known, and will be filled in closer to the scheduled time.<br/>
			This property must be the same between the Appointment-participant and the AppointmentResponse
			so that the appropriate values can be allocated.
			If you need multiple actors of a specific type, then multiple participants with that type value
			are included on the appointment.
		</p>
<a name="statuses"></a>
    <h3>Appointment Statuses and Encounters</h3>
    <p>
      Appointments can be considered as Administrative only, and the Encounter is expected to have
      clinical implications.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, it is expected that appointments will result in the creation of an Encounter.
      The encounter is typically created when the service starts, not when the patient arrives.
      When the patient arrives, an appointment can be marked with a status of Arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an Emergency Room context, the appointment Resource is probably not appropriate to be used.
      In these cases, an Encounter should be created.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Appointment request pattern used is different from the order-response pattern used elsewhere in FHIR.<br/>
      This is due to the close relationship to the iCal standard. Many non-clinical systems use generic
      non-health appointment systems which implement this standard, and the desire to integrate
      with the consumer who has no access to health based software is highly desirable.<br/>
      The mappings to the iCal standard have been provided to guide implementation of gateways between
      FHIR servers and iCal systems.
    </p>
<a name="location"></a>
		<h3>Appointment Locations and Participation</h3>
		<p>
			The location of the appointment is to be defined by using a participant that references a Location
			or HealthcareService resource.<br/>
			This permits the location to also have its availability checked via a schedule and any
			conflicts more easily managed.
