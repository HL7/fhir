	<h2>Notes:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Placer/Filler (<a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=185">HL7 v2</a>)<br/>
			The appointment information is effectively the same between the filler and placer, and given the nature of the
			FHIR resource, there is only a single resource for both purposes. The placer is the actor that performs the
			PUT or POST operation on the resource, and the filler is the actor that receives these resource messages and
			processes the information and makes a decision if the appointment can be used.
		</li>
		<li>Terminology - ServiceCategory, ServiceType and Specialty<br/>
			The 3 core clinical terminologies associated with the appointment may have relationships with each other
			through the terminology server, but not these might not be visible in the actual appointment resource or profile.
		</li>
		<li>Interaction with other Standards<br/>
			The strong desire is that implementers of this resource should consider providing this resource
			in the iCalendar format as an alternative representation. Many 3rd party applications and component providers
			have parsers and user interface controls to display this information.
			This may lower the entry point to integrate outside the health-care specific applications, and into the
			consumer space. This would permit the easier creation of a mobile application that creates appointments
			in the devices native calendar.<br/>
			The iCalendar specification can be found at <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt</a>.

[%stu-note dstu%]
Implementer feedback is sought on the values for Appointment.priority and how interoperable they are.
Using an extension to record a CodeableConcept for named values may be tested at a future Connectathon.<br/>
Implementer feedback is also sought to clarify desired relationship linkages between ServiceCategory, 
ServiceType and Specialty, along with how they have approached the definition.
