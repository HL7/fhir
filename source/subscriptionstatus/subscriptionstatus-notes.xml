  <h2>Timing and Currency</h2>
  <p>
    This resource is used to communicate information about a <a href="subscription.html">Subscription</a> and the events represented by a notification bundle. The process of sending a notification (e.g., a notification this status is included with) can change the status of that subscription. Servers SHALL populate elements with the most recent information at the time of generation (e.g., when a notification is created) and receivers SHOULD be aware that this information might not be current at the time a notification is processed (e.g., a subscription was <code>active</code> but has subsequently moved to an <code>error</code> state).
  </p>

  <a name="content-phi"/>
  <h2>Content and PHI</h2>
  <p>
    Subscription notifications MAY contain PHI. Applications are responsible for following <a href="security.html">FHIR security guidance</a> and compliance with relevant security requirements (e.g., corporate policy, government regulation, etc.). Hinting for the allowed amount of PHI is available in the relevant <code>Subscription</code> resource, via the channel and payload information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since Subscription Topic definitions contain human-readable descriptions and definitions, the purpose of a topic may be understood by viewing the resource.  Given that canonical links to topics are intended to be resolvable and/or searchable (e.g., indexed in a registry), it is assumed that anyone with a link to a topic also knows what that topic is about. Thus, topics MAY be considered PHI and SHOULD be reviewed before inclusion in a notification.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hinting about when a canonical topic URL may be included with a notification can be derived from a subscription's payload level.  E.g.:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>empty</code>: SHOULD NOT be present</li>
    <li><code>id-only</code>: MAY be present</li>
    <li><code>full-resource</code>: SHOULD be present</li>
  </ul>

	<a name="notification-types"/>
	<h2>Notification Types</h2>
	<p>
		This specification describes five distinct outbound notification types: <em>Event</em>, <em>Handshake</em>, <em>Heartbeat</em>, <em>Query Status</em>, and <em>Query Event</em>. For each, the notification body is a <a href="bundle.html">subscription-notification Bundle</a> with a <a href="subscriptionstatus.html">SubscriptionStatus</a> resource used to convey Subscription and notification details.
	</p>

		<a name="event-notification"/>
		<h3>Event Notification</h3>
    <p>The primary notification bundle type is a notification about an event.</p>

    <a name="handshake-notification"/>
		<h3>Handshake Notification</h3>
		<p>
			When a connection to an Endpoint is established or re-established, a server MAY send a Handshake notification to the endpoint.
		</p>
		<p>
			The client expectations upon receipt of a Handshake notification differ for each channel type (e.g., for the <code>rest-hook</code> channel type, a client endpoint responds to event notifications with standard HTTP response codes).
		</p>
    <table class="grid">
      <tr><th>Element</th><th>Optionality</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
      <tr><td>SubscriptionStatus.status</td><td>Recommended</td><td>Current status of the relevant subscription (e.g., <code>active</code>).</td></tr>

      <tr><td>SubscriptionStatus.eventsSinceSubscriptionStart</td><td>Optional</td><td>For a new Subscription, if this value is present it SHALL be zero (0).<br/>A sender MAY send a handshake with a non-zero number of events, for example as process for re-establishing communication after an error state.<br/>Note: this value SHALL NOT be incremented by sending a <code>handshake</code> notification.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>SubscriptionStatus.eventsInNotification</td><td>Optional</td><td>If present, this value SHALL be zero (0).</td></tr>

		<p>
			The client is not expected to take any special action in receipt of a Handshake notification beyond the channel-specific requirement for receiving an event notification.
		</p>

		<a name="heartbeat-notification"/>
		<h3>Heartbeat Notification</h3>
		<p>
			Servers MAY periodically send notifications across a channel to ensure that the connection is still alive and valid (e.g., in accordance with a client's requested heartbeat interval). A heartbeat notification is an empty subscription-notification Bundle sent without incrementing the subscription event count.
		</p>
		<p>
			A client SHOULD use a hearbeat notification to verify that no events have been missed (if possible). However, a client is not required to take any action in receipt of a heartbeat beyond the channel-specific requirement for receiving an event notification (e.g., accepting the notification bundle with an HTTP 200).

    <a name="query-status"/>
    <h3>Query Status</h3>
    <p>
      Clients can ask a server at any time for the current status of a Subscription via the <a href="subscription-operation-status.html">$status operation</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the <code>$status</code> operation is part of the FHIR REST API, the guidance below assumes that a user has been authenticated and is allowed access to all relevant resources.

    <h3>Query Event</h3>
    <p>
      Some servers may allow clients to ask for events which have already occurred.  Notification bundles returned by such operations or queries should use the <code>query-event</code> type.

  <a name="errors"/>
  <h2>Notifications and Errors</h2>
  <p>
    If a server encounters errors while sending a notification, the server may retry the notification a fixed number of times and/or refer errors to its own alert logs. If the notification fails, the server SHOULD set the status of the subscription to <code>error</code>. If the error would be useful to a client (e.g., notification failed because the destination SSL certificate expired), servers SHOULD track errors and provide details to the client.  If a notification retry attempt succeeds, the server SHOULD update the status to <code>active</code> and MAY remove any error codes. If a subscription fails consistently a server may choose set the subscription status to <code>off</code> and stop trying to send notifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Errors a server wishes to make accessible to clients are stored in <code>Subscription.error</code>. Servers should provide a mechanism for clearing errors (e.g., when resetting a <code>Subscription.status</code> back to <code>requested</code> after an error). Since <code>Subscription.error</code> represents server errors, a server SHOULD NOT allow clients to add errors.
  </p>

<a name="errors-delivery"/>
<h3>Detecting Delivery Errors</h3>
<p>
  There are several mechanisms available to subscribers in order to understand the current state of notification delivery.  Below are some example error scenarios with details about how a subscriber can detect the problem state.
</p>

<a name="errors-missing-event"/>
<h4>Missing Event</h4>
<p>
  The diagram below shows how a subscriber can use the <code>SubscriptionStatus.eventsSinceSubscriptionStart</code> parameter on received notifications to determine that an event has been missed.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="subscription-error-missing-event.svg" alt="Diagram showing a missed-event detection and recovery workflow"/>
  <figcaption>Diagram showing a missed-event detection and recovery workflow</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  In the above sequence, the subscriber tracks the <code>eventsSinceSubscriptionStart</code> of each received notification (per Subscription).  When the subscriber received event 23, the subscriber was aware that the last notification it received was a single notification for event 21.  The subscriber then waited an amount of time to ensure that event 22 was indeed missing (and not, for example, still being processed) and started a recovery process.  The recovery process itself will vary by subscriber, but should be a well-understood method for recovering in the event of errors.
</p>

<a name="errors-broken-communication"/>
<h4>Broken Communication</h4>
<p>
  The diagram below show how a subscriber can use the <code>Subscription.heartbeatPeriod</code> to determine errors which prevent notifications from reaching the endpoint.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="subscription-error-missing-event.svg" alt="Diagram showing broken communication detection and recovery workflow" />
  <figcaption>Diagram showing broken communication detection and recovery workflow</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  In the above sequence, the subscriber is aware that the <code>heartbeatPeriod</code> has elapsed for a subscription without receiving any notifications.  The subscriber then asks the server for the <code>$status</code> of the subscription, and seeing an error, begins a recovery process.  As in the previous scenario, the recovery process itself will vary by subscriber, but should be a well-understood method for recovering in the event of errors.
</p>

<a name="recovering-from-errors"/>
<h4>Recovering from Errors</h4>
<p>
  Clients are responsible for devising an appropriate method for recovering from errors.  Often, this process will include a series or batch of requests that allow a client to know the current state.  For example, an application may need to query all relevant resources for a patient in order to ensure nothing has been missed.  Once an application has returned to a functional state, it should request the subscription is reactivated by updating the <code>status</code> to either <code>requested</code> or <code>active</code> as appropriate.
</p>

<a name="using-events-operation"/>
<h4>Using the <code>$events</code> operation</h4>
<p>
  Servers MAY choose to support the <code>$events</code> operation, as defined on the <code>Subscription</code> resource.  The <code>$events</code> operation allows clients to request events which have occurred in the past.  Servers which implement the operation MAY use implementation-specific criteria to restrict availability of events (e.g., most recent 10 events, events within the past 30 days, etc.).
</p>
<p>
  During a recovery process, clients MAY try to retrieve missing events via the <code>$events</code> operation, which should allow processing to continue as normal.
