<h2>Diagnostic Medicine Module</h2>

<a name="intro"> </a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The Diagnostics Module provides an overview and guide to the FHIR content that addresses ordering and reporting of clinical diagnostics including laboratory testing, imaging and genomics.</p>

<a name="index"> </a>
<h3>Index</h3>
<p>The Diagnostics module covers the following resources:</p>

<table width="100%" style="table-layout: fixed">
 <tr>
 <td width="33%">
<ul>
<li><a href="observation.html">Observation</a></li>
<li><a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReport</a></li>
<li><a href="diagnosticrequest.html">DiagnosticRequest</a></li>
  </ul>
</td>
 <td width="33%">
<ul>
<li><a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a></li>
<li><a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a></li>
<li><a href="sequence.html">Sequence</a></li>
</ul>
</td>
 <td width="33%">
<ul>
 <li><a href="specimen.html">Specimen</a></li>
 <li><a href="bodysite.html">BodySite</a></li>
 </ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

   <p>The diagnostic resources and their relationships are shown below.  The arrows represent the direction of the references between resources (for example, DiagnosticReport references DiagnosticRequest). See the <a href="workflow-module.html">Workflow Module</a> for information about the coordination of activities such as ordering and fulfilling of diagnostics.</p>

<h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
<p>
The diagnostic resources often represent patient-related data, and as such are susceptible to data breaching.  Necessary privacy and security provision must be in place for searching and fetching this information.  For more general considerations, see <a href="secpriv-module.html">the Security and Privacy module</a>.
</p>

<a name="uses"> </a>
<h3>Common use Cases</h3>
<p>
Diagnostic resources are commonly used as to order and report clinical diagnostics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordering a Laboratory Test such as a <a href="diagnosticrequest-example-lipid.html">lipid panel</a></li>
<li>Reporting a Laboratory Test such as a <a href="diagnosticreport-example-lipids.html">lipid panel</a></li>
<li>Ordering an imaging study such as a <a href="diagnosticrequest-example-di.html">CT study</a></li>
<li>Reporting an imaging study such as a <a href="imagingstudy-example.html">CT study</a></li>
<li>Ordering a genetics test  such as a <a href="diagnosticrequest-genetics-example-1.html">gene mutation analysis </a></li>
<li>Reporting a genetics test such as <a href="diagnosticreport-hla-genetics-results-example.html">HLA genotyping</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
There are many ways to use these resources independently as well.  The Observation resource in particular is central to capturing many measurements and events in healthcare and is often used outside the context of diagnostic orders and reports.
</p>
<ul>
<li>recording vital signs such as <a href="observation-example-f202-temperature.html">temperature</a></li>
<li>recording other observations such as patient's social history like tobacco use</li>
<li>recording other characteristics of subject such as pregnancy status (note: The Condition resource may be used to represent these as well)</li>
<li>recording clinical assessment tool scores such as an <a href="observation-example-5minute-apgar-score.html">Apgar score</a>.</li>
<li>identifying and describing a <a href="specimen-example-serum.html">specimen</a> or <a href="bodysite-example-tumor.html">body site</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Related Resources and Modules</h3>
<p> The resources that represent the basic information about a patient and a clinical encounter can be found in the <a href ="Admististration Module">Administration Module</a>. Other resources that represent core clinical information generated by healthcare providers during the course of a patient encounter are detailed in the <a href="clinicalsummary-module.html">Clinical Summary Module</a> and the <a href="medications-module.html">Medications Module</a>.</p>

<a name="roadmap"> </a>
<h3>Developmental Roadmap</h3>
<p>


<ul>
<li>The <code>Observation</code> and <code>Diagnostic Report</code> resources have been tested and used in production tooling and as such have reached a <a href="resource.html#maturity">maturity level (FMM)</a> where changes become less likely.</li>
<li>The <code>ImagingStudy</code> resource has had some limited testing and use.  Further use of this resource in production tooling in order for it to reach a more stable FMM level.</li>
</ul>
<p>These other diagnostic resources are still under development:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DiagnosticRequest</code>: used in the HL7 production tooling and in several implementation guides. As a result of the addition of <a href="workflow.html">FHIR workflow</a> for STU3, the <code>DiagnosticRequest</code> resources has undergone substantial changes since DSTU2. It has been renamed from <code>DiagnosticOrder</code> and its structure and content updated to align with a general "request" pattern.  Because of this, it remains an immature resource.</li>
<li><code>Specimen</code>: We expect to see more widespread use of this resource and future updates to its FMM level</li>
<li><code>ImagingManifest</code>: We expect to see more widespread use of this resource and future updates to its FMM level</li>
<li><code>Sequence</code>: This resource remains draft and we expect to see more widespread use of this resource and future updates to its FMM level</li>
<li><code>BodySite</code>: This resource remains draft and its whether it remains a FHIR core resource is still uncertain.  It can only be referenced using extensions.</li>
</ul>
