It may have known issues or still be in the &quot;in development&quot; stage. It is included in the publication as a place-holder, to solicit feedback from the implementation community and/or to give implementers some insight as to functionality likely to be included in future versions of the specification. Content at this level should only be implemented by the brave or desperate and is very much &quot;use at your own risk&quot;.
