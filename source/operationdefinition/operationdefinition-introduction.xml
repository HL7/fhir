<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The OperationDefinition resource provides a formal computable definition of an <a href="operations.html">operation</a> or <a href="search.html#advanced">a named query</a>.
The OperationDefinition serves two principal purposes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>To allow for automatic determination of system compatibility</li>
 <li>To allow for dynamic generation of forms to drive the operations</li>
</ul>
<p>
See below for further information about these, and about how operations and named queries are executed.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
OperationDefinitions are published to define operations that servers can implement in a common fashion. 
The FHIR specification itself describes some (see below), and other organizations (including 
IHE, national programs, jurisdictions and vendors) are able to publish additional OperationDefinitions.
</p>
<p>
OperationDefinition resources are referred to from two different places:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>From a <a href="capabilitystatement.html">CapabilityStatement</a>, to declare what operations a system does or should implement</li>
 <li>From another OperationDefinition resource. This allows for a server to describe a limited implementation of a standard operation, or to allow traceability if the server has to rename the operation due to a name clash</li>
</ul>
<p>
OperationDefinitions can be used to define a custom query (kind = query, discussed below) which 
functions as a special kind of search. This is different to a SearchParameter because a custom query 
may define multiple parameters and can define of complex search behavior beyond what SearchParameter can specify. 
It also typically overrides the behavior of the query functionality, while search parameters can only act 
as additional filters.
