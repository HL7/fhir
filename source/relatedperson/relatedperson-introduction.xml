<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
RelatedPersons typically have a personal or non-healthcare-specific professional relationship to the patient. A RelatedPerson resource is primarily used for attribution of information, 
since RelatedPersons are often a source of information about the patient. For keeping information about persons for contact purposes for a patient, use a Patient's Contact element instead.
</p>
<p>
Example RelatedPersons are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A patient's wife or husband</li>
<li>A patient's relatives or friends</li>
<li>A neighbor bringing a patient to the hospital</li>
<li>The owner or trainer of a horse</li>
<li>A patient's attorney or guardian</li>
</ul>
