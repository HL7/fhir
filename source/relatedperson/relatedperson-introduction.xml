<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
RelatedPersons typically have a personal relationship or non-healthcare-specific professional relationship to the patient. A RelatedPerson 
resource is primarily used for attribution of information, 
since RelatedPersons are often a source of information about the patient. 
For keeping information about people for contact purposes for a patient, use a Patient's Contact element. 
Some individuals may serve as both a Patient's Contact and a Related Person.
</p>
<p>
Example RelatedPersons are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A patient's wife or husband</li>
<li>A patient's relatives or friends</li>
<li>A neighbor bringing a patient to the hospital</li>
<li>The owner or trainer of a horse</li>
<li>A patient's attorney or guardian</li>
<li>A Guide Dog</li>
</ul>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
	The primary distinction between a Practitioner and a RelatedPerson is based on whether:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	The person/animal operates on behalf of the care delivery organization over multiple patients (Practitioner) or,
</li>
<li>
	Where the person/animal is not associated with the organization, and instead is
	allocated tasks specifically for the RelatedPerson's Patient (RelatedPerson).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
	A standard extension <a href="extension-practitioner-animalspecies.html">animalSpecies</a> can be used to indicate the species of a service animal.
