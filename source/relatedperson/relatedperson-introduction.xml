<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
RelatedPersons typically have a personal relationship or non-healthcare-specific professional relationship to the patient. A RelatedPerson 
resource is primarily used for attribution of information, 
since RelatedPersons are often a source of information about the patient. 
For keeping information about people for contact purposes for a patient, use a Patient's Contact element. 
Some individuals may serve as both a Patient's Contact and a Related Person.
</p>
<p>
Example RelatedPersons are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A patient's wife or husband</li>
<li>A patient's relatives or friends</li>
<li>A neighbor bringing a patient to the hospital</li>
<li>The owner or trainer of a horse</li>
<li>A patient's attorney or guardian</li>
<li>A Guide Dog</li>
</ul>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
	The primary distinction between a Practitioner and a RelatedPerson is based on whether:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	The person/animal operates on behalf of the care delivery organization over multiple patients (Practitioner) or,
</li>
<li>
	Where the person/animal is not associated with the organization, and instead is
	allocated tasks specifically for the RelatedPerson's Patient (RelatedPerson).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
	A standard extension <a href="[%extensions-location%]StructureDefinition-practitioner-animalSpecies.html">animalSpecies</a> can be used to indicate the species of a service animal.
</p>
<p>
	When individual represented by a RelatedPerson is also a patient, that same individual may be represented by
	both a RelatedPerson and Patient resource, Patient.link provides the indication that they are the same individual.<br/>
	The RelatedPerson resource is used when that person is involved in the care of some other patient, while the
	Patient resource is used when the person is themselves the target of care.<br/>
	For example, a mother could be a Patient when receiving care for herself, but the mother could also be a RelatedPerson
	when involved in the care of her child.  See the <a href="patient.html#maternity">Mother and newborn relationships</a>
	section for more details on that example.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Boundaries between this and <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/admin-incubator/StructureDefinition-PersonalRelationship.html">PersonalRelationship</a></b><br/>
	The RelatedPerson resource contains the details of both the individual and their relationship to the patient.
	RelatedPerson would be used when the individual is documented within the context of a patient's chart.
</p>
<p>
	RelatedPerson can be an actor and do things.  PersonalRelationship cannot do things.  PersonalRelationship is one way
	you can discover someone who can do things. A PersonalRelationship does not automatically indicate that the target
	individual may NOT be assumed to take actions on behalf of a source individual.
