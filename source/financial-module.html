<h2>Financial Module</h2>

<a name="intro"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The Financial module covers the resources and services provided by FHIR to support the costing, financial transactions and billing which occur within
a healthcare provider as well as the eligibility, enrollment, authorizations, claims and payments which occur between healthcare providers
and insurers and the reporting and notification between insurers and subscribers and patients.

<h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
<p>
Financial information in general and in particular when related to or including health information, such as claims data, are typically considered
Protected Health Information and as such must be afforded the same protection and safeguards as would be afforded to purely clinical identified health data.
</p>
<p>
The Security and Privacy measures associated with FHIR, such as the use of Security labels and tags in the resource.meta, are
encouraged in addition to the use of whatever measures for authorization and encryption are supported by the chosen exchange model,
e.g. FHIR REST, Web Services, Direct, MLLP, SMTP and others.
</p>
<p>
For more general considerations, see <a href="secpriv-module.html">the Security and Privacy module</a>.

<h3>Common Use Cases</h3>

 <p>
 The table below details various common business activities which occur in the financial realm, and the focal resources
 which may be exchanged, along with supporting resources, to accomplish the business activities. Whether the
 resources specified are actually needed requires consideration of the business itself and the exchange methodology
 and transport being used.
 </p>
 <p>
 For example: If a content model is not required to obtain the appropriate status element then a SEARCH (GET) may be used,
 however if a content model is required to support the request for information then the content model will need to be CREATEd (POST).
 Alternately, if FHIR Operations are being used then
 the specified focal resource may be employed as one of the Operation parameters or might not be required.

 <p>
 <b>{discipline}</b> means the type of claim: OralHealth, Vision, Pharmacy, Professional or Institutional.
 </p>
  <p>
 <b>{Resource}</b> means any pended or undelivered resource subject to the selection details specified in the request.
 </p>

<a name="tasks"></a>
<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p> See the Financial examples in <a href="task.html">Task</a>. </p>
<p>
In addition to supplying a reference to a focal resource in the .focus element, where appropriate an .input element 
of type 'origresponse' may also be provided with a reference to the resource which was the original response to the focal resource. 
</p>

<a name="cancel"></a>
<h4>Cancel</h4>
<p>
The <b>Cancel</b> is the formal request to cease processing an incomplete prior request or to reverse 
a completed prior request or information submission. A copy of the original request may be retained. The Task will be updated to indicate 
whether the requested action was accepted and successful or whether errors were found in the request and 
 may contain a reference to the ClaimResponse or such other resource as may be appropriate for expressing the outcome of the cancellation.
</p>
<a name="nullify"></a>
<h4>Nullify</h4>
<p>
The <b>Nullify</b> is the formal request to cease processing an incomplete prior request or to reverse 
a completed prior request or information submission. All copies 
of the original submission are to be purged, although audit logs may be retained. The Task will be updated to indicate 
whether the requested action was accepted and successful or whether errors were found in the request.
</p>
<a name="poll"></a>
<h4>Poll</h4>
<p>
<b>Poll</b> provides supporting information for the poll request. The response to 
a Poll is a Task referring to: a previously undelivered response Resource; a Bundle containing one or more Resources; or, a Task which may 
contain errors. 
</p>
<p>
A simple Poll request, one which doesn't specify additional .input parameters: origresponse, include, exclude, period or count; would return
any single pended resource. Specific types of business behaviors may be supported by providing values for the
filtering elements in the .input element, for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Get any pended resource - no filters specified</li>
<li>Get deferred response to a Claim - specify the Claim in the .focus and optionally the original response in 'origresponse'</li>
<li>Get all supporting information - specify 'Communication' as an 'include'</li>
<li>Get an Explanation of Benefit - specify 'ExplanationOfBenefit' as an 'include'</li>
<li>Get any resource except Explanation of Benefit - specify 'ExplanationOfBenefit' as an 'exclude'</li>
<li>Get a payment reconciliation - specify a 'period' which contains the expected reconciliation 
creation date, and specify 'PaymentReconciliation' as an 'include'</li> 
<li>Get a bundle containing more than one resource - specify the maximum number in 'count'</li>
</ul>
<p>
Upon processing of the request the Task or Bundle may contain errors or a reference to the resource(s) found.
</p>
<a name="release"></a>
<h4>Release</h4>
<p>
<b>Release</b> is the formal request for the release of any allocation or reserved resources such as funds or products reserved, for example  
on a preauthorization, which have not been consumed, eg. as indicated on claims, and which are no longer required. The preauthorization which request ed the reservation
will be identified in the .focus element and the insurer's response confirming the reservation may be provided as a .input element.
</p>

<a name="reprocess"></a>
<h4>Reprocess</h4>
<p>
<b>Reprocess</b> indicates the resource which is to be reprocessed in the .focus element, for example a claim to be re-adjudicated or a specimen or diagnostic image to be re-examined, 
and provides both supporting information for the reprocessing and the line items which are to be reprocessed in the .input element.
</p>
<p>
This is necessary for the limited supporters who require the ability to formally request the 
reprocessing of specified service sub-trees from an already processed resource such as a previously adjudicated Claim. Upon processing of the request the
 Task may contain errors or a reference to the ClaimResponse or such other resource as may be appropriate for expressing the outcome of the reprocessing.
</p>

<a name="status"></a>
<h4>Status</h4>
<p>
<b>Status</b> indicates the resource for which the processing status is requested in the .focus element and 
provides any supporting information for the status request. The 
</p>
<p>
This is a formal request for systems which require requisition-level information or transports which don't support a
'Get Operation', for the processing status of a previously submitted processing request.
</p>
<p>
Upon processing of the status request the Task may contain errors or a .output parameter of 'status' containing the status of outcome code of the processing
of the targeted resource.
</p>

<h3>Relative Order of Use</h3>

 <a name="resource-status"></a>
<h3>Resource Status Life-cycle</h3>
<p>
Financial resources, such as claim and eligibility resources, begin with the status 'draft' and continue with this status during the 
development of the resource. When a resource is exchanged with an external party, for example when a provider claim is sent or 
otherwise created on the insurer's system before the exchange the status of the claim shall be changed to 'active'. A resource with 
the 'active' status is immutable and cannot be edited except for further change to the status in the event the resource is subsequently 
canceled resulting in a status of 'cancel'.
</p>
<p>
In the event that a resource is determined to have been entered in error, for example a wrong date of service or billing code, while the
status is 'draft' then the status may be changed to 'entered-in-error' and no further editing of the resource is permitted. If the resource 
status is 'active' when the error is noted then the resource must be canceled and further interaction with whatever parties have been supplied 
the resource may be required to halt any processing or reverse any effects of the resource prior to creating an amended instance.
</p>
<a name="secondary-use"></a>
<h3>Secondary Uses</h3>
<p>
In addition to their primary use of conveying patient billing information to insurers for reimbursement either to the subscriber or the provider (assignment of benefit), many of the
financial resources, such as <a href="claim.html">Claim</a> and <a href="explanationofbenefit.html">ExplanationOfBenefit</a>, may be used to export data to other agencies to support reporting and analytics.
</p>

<a name="attachments"></a>
<h3>Attachments - Supporting Information</h3>
<p>
There is often a need to provide supporting information, commonly referred to as <b>attachments</b>, to document the need for a service
and/or to confirm that the good or service was authorized or rendered.
This information may be in many forms, including: scanned documents, PDFs, word processing files, XRays, images, CDAs and FHIR Resources.
</p>
<p>
Supporting information may be provided, as a reference or the actual material, to support the <a href="claim.html">Claim</a> (complete claim or Pre-Authorization) or <a href="explanationofbenefit.html">ExplanationOfBenefit</a> in a variety of manners:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Included</b>: in the <i>{resource}</i>.information section;</li>
<li><b>Unsolicited</b>: in a <a href="communication.html">Communication</a> which refers to the Claim or Explanation Of Benefit; or</li>
<li><b>Solicited</b>: in a <a href="communication.html">Communication</a> in response to a <a href="communicationrequest.html">CommunicationRequest</a> from the insurer requesting more information; or</li>
<li><b>Input</b>: in the input parameters of a FHIR operation or Task.input element if a <a href="task.html">Task</a> resource is used.</li>
</ul>


<a name="roadmap"></a>
<h3>Developmental Roadmap</h3>
<p>
The Financial Management Work Group (FM) is responsible for two subdomains:
</p>
<p>
Financial Accounts and Billing (FIAB) - resources for accounts, charges (internal costing transactions) and patient billing, and<br/>
Financial Claims and Reimbursement (FICR) - insurance information, enrollment, eligibility, predetermination, preauthorization, claims, patient reporting and payments.
</p>
<p>
To date FM has been focusing on the resources required to support the exchange of claims and related information between health care providers and insurers. The first draft of this work
is nearing completion with the release of the first Financial Standard for Trial Use in STU3 of FHIR. Over the next year further refinements will be expected as we begin developing regional profiles
and begin live pilots with resources.
</p>
<p>
Once the above is well underway FM can then look to developing the Enrollment-related resources and the resources to support the FIAB functions.
</p>

<a name="terminology"></a>
<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>
In many cases an <b>example</b> valueset has been provided in this release. Financial Management will be devoting effort in the
preparation to Release 4 of FHIR to develop more representative example sets and to determine where global codesets exist such
that some of the valuesets may be elevated in strength to extensible or required.
