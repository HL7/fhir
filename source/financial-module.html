<h2>Financial Module</h2>

<a name="intro"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The Financial module covers the resources and services provided by FHIR to support the costing, contracting, financial transactions and billing which occur within
a healthcare provider as well as the eligibility, enrollment, authorizations, claims, contracts and payments which occur between healthcare providers
and insurers and the reporting and notification between insurers, subscribers, patients and other parties.

<h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
<p>
Financial information in general and in particular when related to or including health information, such as claims data, are typically considered
Protected Health Information and as such must be afforded the same protection and safeguards as would be afforded to purely clinical identified health data.
</p>
<p>
The Security and Privacy measures associated with FHIR, such as the use of Security labels and tags in the resource.meta, are
encouraged in addition to the use of whatever measures for authorization and encryption are supported by the chosen exchange model,
e.g. FHIR REST, Web Services, Direct, MLLP, SMTP and others.
</p>
<p>
For more general considerations, see <a href="secpriv-module.html">the Security and Privacy module</a>.

<h3>Common Use Cases</h3>

 <p>
 The table below details various common business activities which occur in the financial realm, and the focal resources
 which may be exchanged, along with supporting resources, to accomplish the business activities. Whether the
 resources specified are actually needed requires consideration of the business itself and the exchange methodology
 and transport being used.
 </p>
 <p>
 For example: If a content model is not required to obtain the appropriate status element then a SEARCH (GET) may be used,
 however if a content model is required to support the request for information then the content model will need to be CREATEd (POST).
 Alternately, if FHIR Operations are being used then
 the specified focal resource may be employed as one of the Operation parameters or might not be required.

 <p>
 <b>{discipline}</b> means the type of claim: OralHealth, Vision, Pharmacy, Professional or Institutional.
 </p>
  <p>
 <b>{Resource}</b> means any pended or undelivered resource subject to the selection details specified in the request.
 </p>

<a name="tasks"></a>
<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p> See the Financial examples in <a href="task.html">Task</a>. </p>
<p>
In addition to supplying a reference to a focal resource in the .focus element, where appropriate an .input element 
of type 'origresponse' may also be provided with a reference to the resource which was the original response to the focal resource. 
</p>

<a name="cancel"></a>
<h4>Cancel</h4>
<p>
The <b>Cancel</b> is the formal request to cease processing an incomplete prior request or to reverse 
a completed prior request or information submission. A copy of the original request may be retained. The Task will be updated to indicate 
whether the requested action was accepted and successful or whether errors were found in the request and 
 may contain a reference to the ClaimResponse or such other resource as may be appropriate for expressing the outcome of the cancellation.
</p>
<a name="nullify"></a>
<h4>Nullify</h4>
<p>
The <b>Nullify</b> is the formal request to cease processing an incomplete prior request or to reverse 
a completed prior request or information submission. All copies 
of the original submission are to be purged, although audit logs may be retained. The Task will be updated to indicate 
whether the requested action was accepted and successful or whether errors were found in the request.
</p>
<a name="poll"></a>
<h4>Poll</h4>
<p>
<b>Poll</b> provides supporting information for the poll request. The response to 
a Poll is a Task referring to: a previously undelivered response Resource; a Bundle containing one or more Resources; or, a Task which may 
contain errors. 
</p>
<p>
A simple Poll request, one which doesn't specify additional .input parameters: origresponse, include, exclude, period or count; would return
any single pended resource. Specific types of business behaviors may be supported by providing values for the
filtering elements in the .input element, for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Get any pended resource - no filters specified</li>
<li>Get deferred response to a Claim - specify the Claim in the .focus and optionally the original response in 'origresponse'</li>
<li>Get all supporting information - specify 'Communication' as an 'include'</li>
<li>Get an Explanation of Benefit - specify 'ExplanationOfBenefit' as an 'include'</li>
<li>Get any resource except Explanation of Benefit - specify 'ExplanationOfBenefit' as an 'exclude'</li>
<li>Get a payment reconciliation - specify a 'period' which contains the expected reconciliation 
creation date, and specify 'PaymentReconciliation' as an 'include'</li> 
<li>Get a bundle containing more than one resource - specify the maximum number in 'count'</li>
</ul>
<p>
Upon processing of the request, the Task or Bundle may contain errors or a reference to the resource(s) found.
</p>
<a name="release"></a>
<h4>Release</h4>
<p>
<b>Release</b> is the formal request for the release of any allocation or reserved resources such as funds or products reserved, for example  
on a preauthorization, which have not been consumed, e.g. as indicated on claims, and which are no longer required. The preauthorization which request ed the reservation
will be identified in the .focus element and the insurer's response confirming the reservation may be provided as a .input element.
</p>

<a name="reprocess"></a>
<h4>Reprocess</h4>
<p>
<b>Reprocess</b> indicates the resource which is to be reprocessed in the .focus element, for example a claim to be re-adjudicated or a specimen or diagnostic image to be re-examined, 
and provides both supporting information for the reprocessing and the line items which are to be reprocessed in the .input element.
</p>
<p>
This is necessary for the limited supporters who require the ability to formally request the 
reprocessing of specified service sub-trees from an already processed resource such as a previously adjudicated Claim. Upon processing of the request the
 Task may contain errors or a reference to the ClaimResponse or such other resource as may be appropriate for expressing the outcome of the reprocessing.
</p>

<a name="status"></a>
<h4>Status</h4>
<p>
<b>Status</b> indicates the resource for which the processing status is requested in the .focus element and 
provides any supporting information for the status request. 
</p>
<p>
This is a formal request for systems which require requisition-level information or transports which don't support a
'Get Operation', for the processing status of a previously submitted processing request.
</p>
<p>
Upon processing of the status request the Task may contain errors or a .output parameter of 'status' containing the status of outcome code of the processing
of the targeted resource.
</p>

<a name="resource-status"></a>
<h3>Resource Status Life-cycle</h3>
<p>
Financial resources, such as claim and eligibility resources, begin with the status 'draft' and continue with this status during the 
development of the resource. When a resource is exchanged with an external party, for example when a provider claim is sent or 
otherwise created on the insurer's system before the exchange the status of the claim shall be changed to 'active'. A resource with 
the 'active' status is immutable and cannot be edited except for further change to the status in the event the resource is subsequently 
canceled resulting in a status of 'cancel'.
</p>
<p>
In the event that a resource is determined to have been entered in error, for example a wrong date of service or billing code, while the
status is 'draft' then the status may be changed to 'entered-in-error' and no further editing of the resource is permitted. If the resource 
status is 'active' when the error is noted, then the resource must be canceled and further interaction with whatever parties have been supplied 
the resource may be required to halt any processing or reverse any effects of the resource prior to creating an amended instance.
</p>
<a name="secondary-use"></a>
<h3>Secondary Uses</h3>
<p>
In addition to their primary use of conveying patient billing information to insurers for reimbursement either to the subscriber or the provider (
assignment of benefit), many of the financial resources, such as <a href="claim.html">Claim</a> and 
<a href="explanationofbenefit.html">ExplanationOfBenefit</a>, may be used to export data to other agencies to support reporting and analytics. 
Consequently the cardinalities of many elements are set to optional, '0..', to support reporting, for example of partial adjudications, where the 
cardinality for a normal claim profile or claim response profile would expect the cardinality to required, '1..'. </p>
<p>Profiles will usually be necessary 
to set tight constraints on cardinalities, require jurisdictional terminologies, and eliminate or introduce elements require to support various
business needs and discipline requirements.  
</p>

<a name="attachments"></a>
<h3>Attachments - Supporting Information</h3>
<p>
There is often a need to provide supporting information, commonly referred to as <b>attachments</b>, to document the need for a service
and/or to confirm that the good or service was authorized or rendered.
This information may be in many forms, including: scanned documents, PDFs, word processing files, X-Rays, images, CDAs and FHIR Resources.
</p>
<p>
Supporting information may be provided, as a reference or the actual material, to support the <a href="claim.html">Claim</a> (complete claim or Preauthorization) or <a href="explanationofbenefit.html">ExplanationOfBenefit</a> in a variety of manners:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Included</b>: in the <i>{resource}</i>.supportingInfo section;</li>
<li><b>Unsolicited</b>: in a <a href="communication.html">Communication</a> which refers to the Claim or Explanation of Benefit; or</li>
<li><b>Solicited</b>: in a <a href="communication.html">Communication</a> in response to a <a href="communicationrequest.html">CommunicationRequest</a> from the insurer requesting more information; or</li>
<li><b>Input</b>: in the input parameters of a FHIR operation or Task.input element if a <a href="task.html">Task</a> resource is used.</li>
</ul>

<a name="subrogation"></a>
<h3>Subrogation - Insurers recovering costs from other insurers</h3>
<p>
It is not always appropriate to send a Claim, or other eClaim requests such as eligibility or pre-authorizations, to some insurers. This may be due to 
jurisdictional rules, for example the national health program may pay for workplace accident claims then recover costs directly against that program, 
or there may be no direct relationship between the provider and the insurer, for example for injury caused by another party or covered under
property or accident insurance, the patient's primary health insurer may pay for services then recover a portion of their costs from that other insurer.
</p>
<p>To support the downstream recovery of costs from the appropriate insurer it is necessary to supply the insurance coverage information for all logically 
potentially applicable coverages and to flag those which are provided for subrogation so that both the provider and payor systems know whether to expect to
submit eClaims requests to or expect eClaims responses from these insurers. In the specific case of the Claim resource (claim, predetermination, 
preauthorization) the provider would list all insurance coverages, including only work or accident related if appropriate, but send Claims only 
to non-subrogation coverages (Coverage.subrogation=false) and not include ClaimResponses, nor would payors expect ClaimResponses to be provided, for 
subrogated coverages.
</p>

<a name="cob"></a>
<h3>Coordination of Benefit - Handling multiple insurance coverages</h3>
<p>
When a patient has multiple <a href="coverage.html">Coverages</a> there will generally be agreement within the jurisdiction as to the order of
 application of claims recovery against the coverages which is referred to as the Coordination of Benefit (COB) order. This would also be the order
 used to request preauthorization and predeterminations. Coverage eligibility is typically independent of the COB order as it is coverage specific.  
</p>
<p>
While the jurisdiction rules must be consulted for COB specifics, generally: risk specific polices apply before risk-general policies; 
 national policies will apply before personal or top-up policies; 
 coverage obtained with full-time employment applies before coverage obtained with part-time employment; policies where the patient is the 
 subscriber apply before a spouse's policy; and, there will be some understanding as to the order of application for policies which apply to
 dependents, for example, birthday order of the subscribers. 
</p>
<p>
When sending Claims down the COB order all logically applicable policies will be listed, so that insurers may confirm adherence to the COB order,
 and, aside from subrogated coverages, will include the <a href="claimresponse.html">ClaimResponses</a> from any coverages appearing earlier in
 the COB order so that each insurer may correctly calculate their portion of the overall cost of products and services supplied. The claims 
 work their way through the COB order until the order is exhausted or there is no further outstanding balance, whichever comes first.
</p>
<p>
While it is most common, it is not always the case that all claims originate with the provider. In some jurisdictions, in some or all cases,
 the primary health insurer takes or is assigned responsibility to obtain the <a href="claimresponse.html">ClaimResponses</a> from downstream
 insurers and to return the suite of <a href="claimresponse.html">ClaimResponses</a> to the provider. This is similar to subrogation in that
 it removes the claim-cycle work from the provider but unlike subrogation the individual insurers still make their payments to the provider, if 
 Assignment of Benefit is agreed, and a reversal of the base claim often requires the provider to handle reversal of the downstream claims as well.

<h3>Batches - Handling multiple eClaim requests or responses within a single exchange</h3>
<p>
eClaims request and response resources may be exchanged between providers and payors individually or via batches. eClaim requests, individual and batches, 
 may be created on a payor system via FHIR REST or sent to the payor, either synchronously via FHIR operations or another request-response protocol such as:
 WSI Web Services, a SOA exchange, MLLP, etc. 
</p>
<h4>Individual eClaim Requests and Responses</h4>
<p>An individual eClaim request or response, for example a <a href="claim.html">Claim</a> (use=claim), may be either a simple Claim resource which refers to or contains
 any supporting resources or <a href="bundle.html">Bundle</a> resource containing a single request, e.g. a <a href="claim.html">Claim</a>, 
 and any associated resources (Patient, Practitioner, Organization, Coverage, etc.). 
</p>
<h4>eClaim Batches</h4>
<p>A batch of eClaim requests or responses is a (<a href="bundle.html">FHIR Bundle</a>) containing one or more eClaim requests or responses, as above.
The batch is simply a 'bag' of request or responses, typically of a consistent type of request or response, for example: all eligibility, preauthorizations,
 claim, payment notifications, etc. There is no assurance provided that when receiving a batch of 100 claim responses that they relate to the 100 claims 
 just submitted. 
</p> 
<a name="real-time"></a>
<h3>Real-time eClaims Exchange</h3>
<p>
The eClaims resources are intended to support the real-time exchange of eClaim request and responses. While certain eligibility, claims, preauthorizations
 and predeterminations may be processed in real-time there are many cases where they cannot due to the complexity of the material submitted, the
 maturity of the jurisdictional styles and insurer processing systems, and the inclusion or requirements for supporting information which tends to
 require manual review. Therefore, in some cases the eClaim response will only indicate the receipt and typically validation that the request is 
 processable (or that it contain errors which inhibit processing).
</p>
<p>
Deferred responses, those which could not be returned in real-time, and those returned asynchronously may be obtained either by FHIR REST 
 (a GET or SEARCH) or via a <a href="#poll">Poll</a> depending upon the style of information exchange supported.
</p>

<a name="3-tier"></a>
<h3>3-Tier Line Item Hierarchy</h3>
<p>
While most current eClaim data models current only support a single tier structure for line items, that is there is only a list of 'n' line items
to support exchanging multiple services where complex relations between line items are expressed through business rules such as 'put the professional fee
line item before the lab/device/service line item', the FHIR claim-related resources (Claim, ClaimResponse and ExplanationOfBenefit) all support a 3-tier
structure, as illustrated in the diagram below. The tiers are:
<ul> 
  <li>.item, which contains the context information, such as diagnosis and care team and body site, the item service identification and costing, 
  and an optional list of .details. When .details are provided the .item serves as a grouper where the .item costs are the sum of the .detail costs;</li> 
 <li>.detail, which contains detail service identification and costing, and an optional list of .subDetails. When .subDetails are provided 
 the .detail serves as a grouper where the .detail costs are the sum of the .subDetail costs; and</li> 
  <li>.subDetail, which contains detail service identification and costing.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

   <img src="claim-3-tiers.png" alt="Image showing the 3-tiers within the financial resources" height="326px" width="400px" />
    </div>

<p>
The base FHIR specification provides for an unlimited numer of .items and within each .item and unlimited number or .details, and similarly 
and unlimited number of .subDetails within each .detail. It is up to the implementation guides and profiles to determine when .details and .subDetails are permitted
 and the allowable numbers of .items, .details and .subDetails.
</p>

<a name="tax"></a>
<h3>Tax</h3>
<p>
For jurisdictions where tax is billed as a separate line item, through a billing code or category, there is no additional structural 
information required. The handling of Tax should be detailed in the jurisdictional implementation guide and jurisdictional profiles 
should remove unnecessary tax-related elements. Therefore: .net=.quantity * .unitPrice * .factor. Also the jurisdictional implementation 
guide should clarify whether line items are inclusive or exclusive of tax.
</p>
<p>
For jurisdictions where tax is applied per line item/detail/sub-detail etc. a single tax element shall be added to the respective 
strictures for .item, ,item.detail, .item.detail.subdetail and similarly in the addItem structure of the Claim, ClaimResponse and 
ExplanationOfBenefit resources. The Tax element contains the total of any taxes and extensions may be used to breakdown the Tax should 
that be required. Therefore: .net= (.quantity * .unitPrice * .factor) + .tax. The total tax may be reflected in the resource.total 
structure if appropriate.

<h3>Developmental Roadmap</h3>
<p>
The Financial Management Work Group (FM) is responsible for two subdomains:
</p>
<p>
Financial Accounts and Billing (FIAB) - resources for accounts, charges (internal costing transactions) and patient billing, and<br/>
Financial Claims and Reimbursement (FICR) - insurance information, enrollment, eligibility, predetermination, preauthorization, claims, patient reporting and payments.
</p>
<p>
FM has been focusing for R5 on the resources required to support the exchange of claims and related information between health 
care providers and insurers and the payment-related resources (PaymentNotice and PaymentReconciliation). Further effort is required
 to correct and mature the terminologies used in the financial resources.
</p>
<p>
Additionally FM can consider developing the Enrollment-related resources and the resources to support the FIAB functions
 such as 'Statement'.
</p>

<a name="terminology"></a>
<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>
In many cases an <b>example</b> valueset has been provided in this release. Financial Management will be devoting effort in the
preparation to Release 6 of FHIR to develop more representative example sets and to determine where global codesets exist such
that some of the valuesets may be elevated in strength to extensible or required.
