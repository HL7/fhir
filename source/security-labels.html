<p>
A security label is a <a href="datatypes.html#Coding">concept</a> attached to a resource
or bundle that provides specific security metadata about the information it is fixed to.
The <a href="security.html#access-control">Access Control decision engine</a>
uses the security label together with any provenance resources associated with
the resource and other metadata (e.g. the resource type, resource contents, etc.) to</p>
<ul>
  <li>approve read, change, and other operations</li>
  <li>determine what resources can be returned</li>
  <li>determine what handling caveats must be conveyed with the data</li>
</ul>
<p>
Security Labels enable more data to flow as they enable policy fragments to accompany the resource data.
</p>
<p>
The intent of a security label is that the recipient of resources or bundles with security-tags is obligated
to enforce the handling caveats of the tags and carry the security labels forward as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
Security labels are only a device to connect specific resources, bundles, or operations
to a wider security framework; a full set of policy and consent statements and their
consequent obligations is needed to give the labels meaning. Because of this,
security labels are most effective in fully trusted environments - that is,
where all trading partners have agreed to abide by them in a Mutual Trust
Framework. Note also that security labels support policy, and specific tagging
of individual resources is not always required to implement policy correctly.
</p>
<p>
In the absence of this kind of pre-agreement, Security Labels
may still be used by individual parties to assist with security role
checking, but they might not all be recognized and enforced, which in turn
limits what information can flow.
</p>
<p>
Local agreements and implementation profiles for the use security labels should
describe how the security labels connect to the relevant consent and policy
statements, and in particular:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Which Security Labels are able to be used</li>
 <li>What to do if a resource has an unrecognized security label on it</li>
 <li>Authoring obligations around security labels</li>
 <li>Operational implications of security labels</li>
</ul>
<p>
This specification defines a basic set of labels for the most common
use cases trading partners, and a wider array of security labels
that allow much finer grained management of the information.

<h2>Representing Security Labels</h2>

<p>
A security label is represented as a <a href="datatypes.html#Coding">Coding</a>, with the
following important properties:
</p>
<table  class="grid">
  <tr> <td>system</td> <td>The coding scheme from which label is taken (see <a href="terminologies-systems.html">code system URI</a>, and below) </td></tr>
  <tr> <td>code</td> <td>a code from the coding scheme that identifies the security label  and code is a value from the code system</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>display</td> <td>The display form for the code (mostly for use when a system doesn't recognize the code)</td> </tr>
</table>

<div class="example">
<p>
An example XML Patient Resource with a "Restricted" tag associated with it, as represented in an HTTP response:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;Patient xmlns=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir&quot;&gt;

    &lt;security&gt;
      &lt;system value=&quot;http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-Confidentiality&quot;/&gt;

<p>Note: the actual terms used in these examples are described below.</p>

<p>
The basic framework for security labels is described by the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=345">HL7 Healthcare Classification
System</a>. This specification identifies how security labels are defined and provides a
relatively comprehensive list of labels. All the HCS defined labels (see below for the lists)
can be used as security labels on FHIR resources and bundles (e.g. requests and responses).
</p>
<p>
In addition, other security labels not defined here or in the HCS can be defined by
jurisdictions, vendors and/or projects and used as appropriate. However, note that:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Defining additional security labels will increase costs associated with information and system portability</li>
 <li>Implementation guides and applications SHOULD always use the applicable label defined by the HCS if one exists</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: The use of security labels and the expression of common shared security
policies is a matter of ongoing discussion and development in several communities.
</p>

<a name="core"></a>
<h2>Core Security Labels</h2>
<p>
This specification defines a set of core security labels for all FHIR systems.
All conformant FHIR Applications SHOULD use these labels where appropriate.
For all these labels, how they are operationalized - their use and interpretation - is subject
to the applicable Mutual Trust Framework agreement as described above.
</p><p>
The Security Label vocabulary has three patterns of use: (1) Bundle: Security/Privacy considerations of a data set, (2) Context: Describe security/privacy context of a request for data, and (3) Meta Data: to indicate security/privacy meta about that data. 
</p><p>
Bundle: A bundle is a container for a collection of data. Some uses of bundle are for communicating search results, sending data, or persisting data (See Bundle). The Bundle would carry meta about the data contained in the bundle. Specifically the confidentiality 'high water" mark, the authorized purposeOfUse, the required compartment clearance, Refrain, and Obligations that must be maintained. Where the "high water" mark is an indication of the most high confidentiality. Depending on Policy, the Bundle might include the cross-section of sensitivity or integrity, although this is usually not included. 
</p><p>
Context: Requests (e.g. Read, Query, message triggers) - would describe the context of the request using purposeOfUse and compartment/clearance. The request might declare the highest confidentiality desired. It is unlikely to see in a request a declaration of sensitivity or integrity. It is also unlikely to see Obligations within a Request. (See Bundle for Response, where these are appropriate)
</p><p>
Meta Data: All resources have a meta.security element to hold descriptions (meta) about the data relative to privacy and security risk. Thus data may be tagged with confidentiality, sensitivity, and integrity. The data might be tagged with the indication of collection context using compartment or purposeOfUse. Data would not typically be tagged with Refrain, or Obligations.
</p><p>
 More complex use of tagging in the data resource, bundle, context, or in Provenance, is possible.

     but can be modified subsequently as a matter of operational management. The Confidentiality classifications describe the sensitivity of the information in a resource about
     whether it should made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.  <br/> Notes:
     <ul>
      <li>In the absence of a confidentiality code, the basic confidentiality of a resource may be implied by its definition and content; e.g. a patient's condition is far more likely to be confidential than a practitioner resource, and a Diagnostic Report with an HIV test is always highly confidential, whereas a routine electrolytes report is rarely particularly confidential</li>
      <li>The confidentiality of a bundle is always as confidential as the most confidential resource in the bundle</li>
     </ul>
     The additional security labels are more specific to support very specific fine-grained access control and should
     always be used in association with an appropriate confidentiality label. See discussion on HCS below

<h2>Break the Glass</h2>

<p>
There is a special security label to support the commonly encountered "break-the-glass" protocol,
where a clinician (usually in an emergency context) requests emergency
unauthorized access to the patient's record. 
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr>
   <td>Break the Glass</td>
   <td>http://hl7.org/fhir/security-label#break-the-glass</td>
   <td>
    The requester is asking for emergency access for patient treatment. Typically, this means that the patient is unconscious and not able to provide relevant information or consent.
   </td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>
This <a href="v3/PurposeOfUse/vs.html">purpose of use</a> label is represented as a security 
label on the request, rather than on a resource, and so is represented in the request as a 
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-johnston-http-category-header-02">web category</a>:

<p>
While the principle of break-the-glass is well understood, implementing it well
has some challenges. This specification defines a method to represent break-the-glass
in an HTTP request, but does not define any policy or protocol around such requests.
At a minimum, implementations must ensure:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>How, when and why to initiate the break-the-glass is well understood</li>
 <li>Appropriate authorization, consent checking, and access control is used to ensure it is used properly (e.g. if using OAuth, checking that the Authorization Server allows this)</li>
 <li>Any use is well-represented in an <a href="auditevent.html">AuditEvent</a> break the glass <a href="auditevent-example-breakglass-start.html">example</a>.</li>
 <li>Note an example <a href="operationoutcome-example-break-the-glass.html">OperationOutcome that might be used to indicate potential for break-glass</a>.</li>
