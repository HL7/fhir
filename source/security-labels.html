<h1>Security Labels</h1>

<p>
A security label is a <a href="extras.html#tags">tag</a> attached to a resource 
or bundle that provides specific security metadata about the information it is fixed to.
The <a href="security.html#access-control">Access Control decision engine</a> 
uses the security label, along with any provenance resources associated with 
the resource, and other metadata, like resource type and contents etc, to 
approve access, change, and other operations, and to determine what level 
of the resource can be returned and what handling caveats must be conveyed 
with the data. 
</p>
<p>
The recipient of resources or bundles with security-tags is obligated 
to enforce the handling caveats and carry the security labels forward as appropriate.
Security Labels enable more data to flow as they enable
policy fragments to accompany the data as it is exchanged. 
</p>
<p>
Security labels are most effective in fully trusted environments - that is, 
where all trading partners have agreed to abide by them, in a Mutual Trust 
Frameworks. In the absence of this kind of pre-agreement, Security Labels 
may still be used by individual parties to assist with security role 
checking, but they cannot be exchanged between parties in a meaningful 
fashion; hence, less information is allowed to flow. Local agreements 
and implementation profiles for the use security labels should describe:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Which Security Labels are able to be used</li>
 <li>What do if a resource has an unrecognised security label on it</li>
 <li>Authoring obligations around security labels</li>
 <li>Operational implications of security labels</li>
</ul>

<p>
This specification provides a basic simple mutual trust framework below, on which 
more sophisticated mutual trust frameworks can be built by trading partners
using a wider array of security labels.
</p>

<h2>Representing Security Labels</h2>

<p>
A security label is represented as a <a href="extras.html#tags">Tag</a>, with the 
following properties:
</p>
<table>
  <tr> <td>Scheme</td> <td>http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/security</td> <td>Fixed Value for a security label</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Term</td> <td>a URI that identifies the security label</td> <td> Usually of the form [system]#[code], where system is a <a href="terminologies-systems.html">code system uri</a>, and code is an value from the code system</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Label</td> <td>The display name for the code</td> <td>optional - for display to a human (mostly used when a system doesn't recognise the Term)</td> </tr>
</table>

<div class="example">
<p>Note: the actual terms used in these examples are described below.</p>

}
</pre>

</div>

<p>
The basic framework for security labels is described by the HL7 Healthcare Classification 
System (HCS; ref todo). This defines how security labels are defined, and provides a 
relatively comprehensive list of labels. All of the HCS defined labels can be used 
as security labels on FHIR resources, requests, and responses as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
In addition, other security labels not defined here or in the HCS can be defined by 
jurisdictions, vendors, or projects, and used as appropriate. However, note that:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Defining additional security labels will increase costs associated with information and system portability</li>
 <li>Implementation guides and applications SHOULD always use the applicable label defined by the HCS if one exists</li>
</ul>

<a name="core"> </a>
<h2>Core Security Labels</h2>
<p>
This specification defines a set of core security labels for all FHIR systems, 
along with the expected behaviour associated with them. Implementers can expect
that these are implemented as appropriate by all FHIR systems.

     whether it made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.  <br/> Notes:
     <ul>
      <li>In the absence of a confidentiality code, the basic confidentiality of a resource may be implied by it's definition and content. e.g. a patient's condition is far more likely to be confidential than a practitioner resource, and a Diagnostic Report with an HIV test is always highly confidential, where as a routine electrolytes is rarely particularly confidential</li>
      <li>A few resources have an confidentiality code in the resource itself. This should always be understood as the original intended confidentiality, where as a confidentiality tag is the current confidentality of the content. e.g. the confidentiality may change in response to patient concern</li>
      <li>The confidentality of a bundle is always as confidential as the most confidential resource in the bundle</li>
