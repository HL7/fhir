<h1>Security Labels</h1>

<p>
A security label is a <a href="datatypes.html#Coding">concept</a> attached to a resource 
or bundle that provides specific security metadata about the information it is fixed to.
The <a href="security.html#access-control">Access Control decision engine</a> 
uses the security label together with any provenance resources associated with 
the resource and other metadata (e.g. the resource type, resource contents, etc.) to</p>
<ul>
  <li>approve read, change, and other operations</li>
  <li>determine what level of the resource can be returned</li>
  <li>determine what handling caveats must be conveyed with the data</li>
</ul>
<p>
Security Labels enable more data to flow as they enable policy fragments to accompany the resource data.
</p>
<p>
The intent of a security label is that the recipient of resources or bundles with security-tags is obligated 
to enforce the handling caveats of the tags and carry the security labels forward as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
Security labels are only a device to connect specific resources, bundles, or operations 
to a wider security framework; a full set of policy and consent statements and their 
consequent obligations is needed to give the labels meaning. As a consequence of this,
security labels are most effective in fully trusted environments - that is, 
where all trading partners have agreed to abide by them in a Mutual Trust 
Framework. Note also that security labels support policy, and specific tagging
of individual resources is not always required to implement policy correctly. 
</p>
<p>
In the absence of this kind of pre-agreement, Security Labels 
may still be used by individual parties to assist with security role 
checking, but they may not all be recognized and enforced, which in turn
limits what information is allowed to flow.
</p>
<p>
Local agreements and implementation profiles for the use security labels should 
describe how the security labels connect to the relevant consent and policy 
statements, and in particular:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Which Security Labels are able to be used</li>
 <li>What do if a resource has an unrecognized security label on it</li>
 <li>Authoring obligations around security labels</li>
 <li>Operational implications of security labels</li>
</ul>
<p>
This specification defines a basic set of labels for the most common
use cases trading partners, and also a wider array of security labels
that allow much finer grained management of the information.
</p>

<h2>Representing Security Labels</h2>

<p>
A security label is represented as a <a href="datatypes.html#Coding">Coding</a>, with the 
following important properties:
</p>
<table>
  <tr> <td>system</td> <td>The coding scheme from which label is taken (see <a href="terminologies-systems.html">code system URI</a>, and below) </td></tr>
  <tr> <td>code</td> <td>a code from the coding scheme that identifies the security label  and code is an value from the code system</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>display</td> <td>The display form for the code (mostly for use when a system doesn't recognize the code)</td> </tr>
</table>

<div class="example">
<p>
An XML patient resource with a "celebrity" tag associated with it, as represented in an HTTP response:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;Patient xmlns=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir&quot;&gt;
  &lt;meta&gt;
    &lt;security&gt;
      &lt;system value=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;code value=&quot;CEL&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;display value=&quot;Celebrity&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/security&gt;    
  &lt;/meta&gt;
...  [snip] ...
&lt;/Patient&gt;
</pre>
<p>
A JSON search result that includes a resource that the receiving application must delete all copies of the resource after using it:
</p>
<pre>
{
  "resourceType" : "Bundle",
  "type" : "searchset",
  ... other headers etc ....
  "entry" : [
     ... other entries ....
     {
       "resource": {
         "id" : "1",
         "meta" : {
           "security" : [{
             "system" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode",
             "code" : "DELAU",
             "display" : "delete after use"
           }]
         }
         ... other content etc ....
       }
     },
     ... other entries ....
  ]
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>Note: the actual terms used in these examples are described below.</p>

<p>
The basic framework for security labels is described by the HL7 Healthcare Classification 
System (HCS; ref todo). This specification identifies how security labels are defined and provides a 
relatively comprehensive list of labels. All of the HCS defined labels (see below for the lists)
can be used as security labels on FHIR resources and bundles (e.g. requests and responses).
</p>
<p>
In addition, other security labels not defined here or in the HCS can be defined by 
jurisdictions, vendors and/or projects and used as appropriate. However, note that:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Defining additional security labels will increase costs associated with information and system portability</li>
 <li>Implementation guides and applications SHOULD always use the applicable label defined by the HCS if one exists</li>
</ul>

<p>
DSTU Note: The use of security labels and the expression of common shared security 
policies is currently a matter of ongoing discussion and development in several communities
at this time. This is an area where there is likely to be substantial development 
during trial use.

<h2>Core Security Labels</h2>
<p>
This specification defines a set of core security labels for all FHIR systems.
All conformant FHIR Applications SHOULD use these labels where appropriate. 
For all of these labels, how they are operationalised - their use and interpretation - is subject 
to the applicable Mutual Trust Framework agreement as described above.
These codes all come from one of two code systems: 
http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/Confidentiality, and http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode,

 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td colspan="2" style="background-color: #EFEFEF"><b>Context of Use</b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Confidentiality codes</td>
   <td>
     These <a href="v3/Confidentiality/index.html">confidentiality codes</a> (system = http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/Confidentiality) can be applied to any resource or bundle. They are generally assigned by the author of the resource, 
     but can be modified subsequently as a matter of operational management. The Confidentiality codes describe the sensitivity of the information in a resource with regard to 
     whether it should made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.  <br/> Notes:
     <ul>
      <li>In the absence of a confidentiality code, the basic confidentiality of a resource may be implied by its definition and content. e.g. a patient's condition is far more likely to be confidential than a practitioner resource, and a Diagnostic Report with an HIV test is always highly confidential, where as a routine electrolytes is rarely particularly confidential</li>
      <li>A few resources have a confidentiality code in the resource itself. This should always be understood as the original intended confidentiality, where as a confidentiality tag is the current confidentiality of the content. e.g. the confidentiality may change in response to patient concern <!-- Todo: See if we can drop these confidentiality elements and replace with the tagging structure --></li>
      <li>The confidentiality of a bundle is always as confidential as the most confidential resource in the bundle</li>
     </ul>
     The additional more specific labels below are defined to support very specific fine-grained access control, and should 
     always be used in association with an appropriate confidentiality label.

<h2>Break The Glass</h2>

<p>
There is a special security label to support the commonly encountered "break-the-glass" protocol, 
where a clinician (usually in an emergency context) requests emergency 
unauthorized access to the patient's record. 
This specification does not make any policy recommendations or rules
about the operation, merely provides support for it. See 
<a href="http://www.hl7.org/search/viewSearchResult.cfm?search_id=393442&amp;search_result_url=%2Fdocumentcenter%2Fpublic%2Fwg%2Fsecure%2FHL7%20Emergency%20Access%2Edoc">this paper</a> for 
discussion of the issues involved in break-the-glass operations.
</p>
<p>
When the operation occurs, it is represented as a security label on the 
request, rather than on a resource, and so is represented differently,
as a URL:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr>
   <td>Break The Glass</td>
   <td>http://hl7.org/fhir/security-label#break-the-glass</td>
   <td>
    The requester is asking for emergency access for patient treatment. Typically, this means that the patient is unconscious and not able to provide relevant information or consent.
   </td>
 </tr>   
</table>
<p>
The URL is represented in the request as a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-johnston-http-category-header-02">web category</a>:
