 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = RequestCode
  Binding = unbound
  Definition = Codes indicating the details of what is being requested.  These will vary significantly based on the type of request resource and will often be example/preferred rather than extensible/required.

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = PerformerType

  Binding Name = RequestReason
  Binding = unbound
  Definition = Codes identifying why this request was necessary.  These may be clinical reasons (e.g. diagnoses, symptoms) and/or administrative reasons.
