      <p>The value set to instantiate this attribute should be drawn from a terminologically robust code system that consists of or contains method of administration concepts.</p>
      <p>Possible sources include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>SNOMED CT - Children of SCTID: 107733003 "introduction (procedure)" (note: not all concepts in this subset may be suitable)</li>
        <li>ISO 11239 - Administration methods</li>
      </ul>
      <p>SNOMED CT is being used here as the example terminology.</p>
      <p>Note: to avoid confusion with other attributes in this resource concepts that are pre-coordinated with  site and/or route 
        of administration (e.g. "intravenous infusion" where "intravenous" is the route or "rub into left hand" where "left hand" 
        is the site) should not be used in this value set
