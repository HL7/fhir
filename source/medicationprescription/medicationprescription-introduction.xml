<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
This resource covers all orders for medications for a patient.  This includes in-patient medication orders as well as community orders (whether filled by the prescriber or by a pharmacy).  
It also includes orders for over-the-counter medications (e.g. Aspirin) and dietary supplements.  It may be used to support the order of medication-related devices.  It is not intended
for use in prescribing particular diets, or for ordering non-medication-related items (eye-glasses, supplies, etc.)
