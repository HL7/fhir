		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p><b><i>For an overview of this resource and others in the Medication Definition domain, also see the <a href="medication-definition-module.html">module page</a></i></b></p>
		<p>
			A medicinal product may consist of several items, which need to be combined or processed before administration to the patient. 
			
			This resource covers the ready-for-use administrable product - the components of which are 
			<a href="manufactureditemdefinition.html">ManufacturedItemDefinition</a> resources. 
			Note that often the administrable product is the same as the manufactured item.
		</p>
		<p>
			This resource represents the final form of the product; hence it details properties such as the route, that only apply to the final product. 
			It is a definitional resource, representing the properties of a product, but not the actual instance given to someone.
			When necessary to record that, a <a href="medication.html">Medication</a> resource is used.
