		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p><i>For an overview of this resource and others in the Medication Definition domain, also see the <a href="medication-definition-module.html">module page</a></i></p>
		<p>
			A medicinal product may consist of several items, which need to be combined before administration to the patient. 
			The administrable (or "pharmaceutical") product - which differs in that it is now "mixed" from its components (if necessary) and is ready for use - 
			is covered by this resource. The components themselves are <a href="manufactureditemdefinition.html">ManufacturedItemDefinitions</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that, in many cases, the administrable product is equal to the sole manufactured item. 
			However, there are common instances where the manufactured item(s) must undergo a transformation before being administered 
			to the patient (as the pharmaceutical product) and the two are not equivalent.
		</p>
		<p>
			This resource is used to represent the final form of the product as administered (even if the form is no different from the manufactured form),
			and hence it is the location for key properties such as the route - which only make sense in the context of the final physical form. 
			It is however a definitional resource, representing the properties of such a product, but not an actual instance of one physically given to someone.
			There is rarely a need to record that specific entity but it would be a <a href="medication.html">Medication</a> instance 
			in a <a href="medicationadministration.html">MedicationAdministration</a> if so.
