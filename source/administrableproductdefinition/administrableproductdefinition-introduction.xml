		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#999999; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px 4px 4px 4px;"><b><i>For an overview of this resource and others in the Medication Definition domain, also see the <a href="medication-definition-module.html">module page</a></i></b></p>
		<p>
			A medicinal product may consist of several items, which need to be combined or processed before administration to the patient. 
			
			This resource covers the ready-for-use administrable product - the components of which are 
			<a href="manufactureditemdefinition.html">ManufacturedItemDefinition</a> resources. 
			Note that in some cases the administrable product needs no processing or transformation from the manufactured item. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This resource represents the final form of the product; hence it details properties such as the route, that only apply to the final product. 
			It is a definitional resource, representing the properties of a product, but not the actual instance given to someone.
			When necessary to record that, a <a href="medication.html">Medication</a> resource is used. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<i>
			This resource corresponds to the Pharmaceutical Product as defined by the ISO IDMP set of standards, 
			see <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:11615:ed-2:v1:en:term:3.1.2">ISO 11615</a> and <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:11616:ed-2:v1:en:term:3.1.24">ISO 11616</a>. 
			To better align with the HL7 guidelines for supporting different product concepts and to avoid possible confusion 
			with the resources defined in the <a href="medication.html">Medications module</a> of HL7 FHIR, the concept "Administrable Product" has been adopted for the name of this resource, 
			whereas the terms and definitions of other core resources in the <a href="medication-definition-module.html">Medication Definition module</a> do correspond 
			directly to the ISO IDMP terms. 
			See also the <a href="administrableproductdefinition-mappings.html">mapping table</a> for a detailed mapping of this resource to the IDMP Pharmaceutical Product definition.
