<h2>Using Operation Outcome Resources</h2>
<p>
On the RESTful interface, operation outcome resources are only relevant when a level of computable detail is required that is more granular than that provided by the HTTP response codes.
This granularity could include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>more detail about the location of an issue</li>
<li>the ability to identify multiple distinct issues</li>
<li>provision of finer error codes that connect to known business failure states</li>
</ul>

<p>
Operation outcomes returned SHOULD be in alignment with the HTTP response code.  For example, if the HTTP code indicates a failure (300+), at least
one of the issues should have a severity of "error", indicating the reason for the failure.
</p>
