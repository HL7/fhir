<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
Operation Outcomes are sets of error, warning and information messages that provide detailed information about the outcome of some attempted system operation.  
They are provided as a direct system response, or component of one, where they provide information about the outcome of the operation.
</p>

<p>
OperationOutcomes are used in the following circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>When an <a href="http.html#operations">RESTful operation</a> fails</li>
 <li>As the response on a <a href="http.html#validate">validation operation</a>, to provide information about the outcomes</li>
 <li>As part of a message response, usually when the message has not been processed correctly</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div>
<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
This resource is not used for reporting clinical or workflow issues associated with a proposed or ongoing action; 
these would be handled using <a href="contraindication.html">ContraIndication</a> or other resources. The resource  
is not designed to be persisted or referenced from other parts of the workflow. 
</p>
<p>
It is possible to have both <code>OperationOutcome</code> and <a href="contraindication.html">ContraIndication</a> together, where the OperationOutcome might 
indicate that a requested action was rejected due to a clinical issue and the Contraindication provides the details of the issue.
