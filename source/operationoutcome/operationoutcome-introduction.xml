<p>
Operation Outcomes are sets of error, warning and information messages that provide detailed information about the outcome of some attempted system operation.  
They are provided as a direct system response, or component of one, where they provide information about the outcome of the operation.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, OperationOutcomes are used in the following circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>When an <a href="http.html#operations">RESTful operation</a> fails</li>
 <li>As the response on a <a href="http.html#validate">validation operation</a>, to provide information about the outcomes</li>
 <li>As part of a message response, usually when the message has not been processed correctly</li>
</ul>
