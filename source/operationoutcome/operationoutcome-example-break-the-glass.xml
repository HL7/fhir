This is an example of a operation outcome that would be returned
as part of a set of search results (e.g. in the bundle with search.mode = outcome)
to indicate that additional results may be available using the break-the-glass
protocol. The correct use of this is discussed on the [security labels](security-labels.html#break-the-glass) page
