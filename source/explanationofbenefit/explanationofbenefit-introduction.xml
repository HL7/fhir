<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>The ExplanationOfBenefit (EOB) resource combines key information from a Claim, a ClaimResponse and optional Account information to inform 
a patient of the goods and services rendered by a provider and the settlement made under the patient's coverage in respect of that Claim. The
 ExplanationOfBenefit resource may also be used as a resource for data exchange for bulk data analysis, as the resource
 encompasses Claim, ClaimResponse and Coverage/Eligibility information.
</p>
<p>
This is the logical combination of the Claim, ClaimResponse and some Coverage accounting information
 in respect of a single payor prepared for consumption by the subscriber and/or patient. It is not 
 simply a series of pointers to referred-to content models, is a physical subset scoped to the 
 adjudication by a single payor which details the services rendered, the amounts to be settled and 
 to whom, and optionally the coverage allowed under the policy and the amounts used to date.
</p>
<p>
Typically the EOB is only used to convey Claim (use=claim) and the associated ClaimResponse information to patients or subscribers. It may also be 
 used to convey consolidated predetermination and preauthorization request and response information to patients or subscribers. An EOB will never 
 be created for patient or subscriber information exchange if an error was detected in the Claim. 
</p>
<p>
It is also recognized that "EOB" is a term that carries additional meaning in certain areas of the industry. When the resource was originally
 being developed there was substantial discussion about the adoption of an alternative name for the resource but after much discussion it was
 resolved that the ExplanationOfBenefit name has the advantage of familiarity that has been proven through the early adoption of the resource
 for multiple purposes. 
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> when creating profiles for EOB as a patient focused information exchange the payment details, other than date, should be excluded if
 the payee is the provider as that would leak business confidential information.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> the EOB <b>SHALL NOT</b> be used as a replacement for a ClaimResponse when responding to Claims. Only the ClaimResponse contains
 the appropriate adjudication information for a payor response to a Claim.</p>
<p>The ExplanationOfBenefit resource is an "event" resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html#event">Workflow Event.</a></p>

		<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>

		<p>The ExplanationOfBenefit resource is for reporting out to patients or transferring data to patient centered applications, such as patient
		health Record (PHR) application, the <a href="explanationofbenefit.html">ExplanationOfBenefit</a> 
		should be used instead of the <a href="claim.html">Claim</a> and <a href="claimresponse.html">ClaimResponse</a> resources as those
		resources may contain provider and payer specific information which is not appropriate for sharing with	the patient.</p>		
		<p>When using the resources for reporting and transferring claims data, which may have originated in some standard other than FHIR, the Claim resource is useful if only the
	request side of the information exchange is of interest. If, however, both the request and the adjudication information is to be reported then the 
			<a href="explanationofbenefit.html">ExplanationOfBenefit</a> should be used instead.
		</p>
	
		<p>The <a href="claim.html">Claim</a> resource is used to request the adjudication and/or authorization of a set of healthcare-related goods and services for a patient against the patient's insurance coverages, or
	to request what the adjudication would be for a supplied set of goods or services should they be actually supplied to the patient.
		</p>

		<p>When requesting whether the patient's coverage is inforce, whether it is valid at this or a specified date, or requesting the benefit details or preauthorization requirements 
	associated with a coverage <a href="coverageeligibilityrequest.html">CoverageEligibilityRequest</a> should be used instead.
