<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>

<b>DRAFT PLACEHOLDER</b>
The ExplanationOfBenefit resource combines key information from a Claim, a ClaimResponse and optional Account information to inform 
a patient of the goods and services rendered by a provider and the settlement made under the patients coverage in respect of that Claim.
</p>
<p>
This is the logical combination of the Claim, Claim Response and some Coverage accounting information
 in respect of a single payor prepared for consumption by the subscriber and/or patient. It is not 
 simply a series of pointers to referred-to content models, is a physical subset scoped to the 
 adjudication by a single payor which details the services rendered, the amounts to be settled and 
 to whom, and optionally the coverage used and/or remaining.
