<h2>Draft Standard for Trial Use</h2>


<p>
FHIR is being balloted as a Draft Standard for Trial Use.  
A complete description of the rules for DSTU can be found 
in HL7's <a href="http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/HL7_Governance_and_Operations_Manual.pdf">Governance and Operations Manual</a>. 
However, the essential points for implementers are covered below:
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this phase in the
approval process is to gain real-world implementation experience based on a vetted, approved
version of the specification prior to locking any particular aspect of the specification "in stone".
This specification makes a number of statements about what HL7 will and will not do in future
versions of this specification.  These statements generally concern expectations around forward
and backward compatibility and how the specification will evolve.  However, these statements only 
hold once the specification is approved as a "normative" standard - the approval process that will 
occur subsequent to DSTU.  Between different DSTU versions and between the DSTU and final approved
normative version of the specification and its resources, these rules around compatibility and other
issues will not be enforced, and may not be honored.  Elements may be renamed, moved, dropped or otherwise changed.
Extensions may be promoted to core elements and core elements may be demoted to extensions.  Wire
syntax and invocation sequences may be changed.  Other breaking changes may occur.
</p>
<p>
Major changes are not expected, however the risk does exist.  If they occur, such changes will 
not be undertaken without good supporting rationale.  However, long term implementability and 
usefulness of the specification will receive greater weight when evaluating changes that impact on
existing DSTU implementations.  DSTU implementers should therefore provide flexibility in their
architecture that will allow them to more easily accommodate changes to the specification.  They should
also consider how their implementations might peacefully coexist with implementations of future
DSTU and normative versions that may not be fully compatible.
</p>

<h3>Open Issues</h3>

<p>
There are a number of issues in which input based on implementation experience is specifically
sought during the trial use phase:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="conformance.html#dstu">Conformance</a>: How system profiles are used</li>
 <li><a href="order.html#dstu">Order</a>: The need for additional kinds of order to be defined</li>
 <li><a href="managing.html#dstu">Resource Identificatino</a>: Managing resource identification in distributed systems</li>
 <li><a href="search.html#dstu">Query / Search</a>: How should text search be standardized?</li>
 <li><a href="security-labels.html#dstu">Security Labels</a>: How much policy can be standardised, and how does this impact on this specification?</li>
 <li><a href="security.html#dstu">Security</a>: What use cases are there for digital signatures?</li>
 <li><a href="messaging.html#dstu">Messaging</a>: Messaging has not yet been well-exercised at connectathon, so feedback based on implementation is welcome</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, there a are future proposed resources:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A notification resource for creating and recording notifications between parties</li>
 <li>An alarm resource to represent current issues with the </li>
 <li>A person resource to support person registries</li>
 <li>An appointment resource for making and tracking arrangements around the future of care</li>
 <li>Payment related resources, and specifically, Account</li>
 <li>?A way to define particular queries (finer detail than Profile provides)</li>
 <li>One or more resources for Advance Care Directive / Power of Attorney</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that other resources beyond these may be anticipated.
</p>
<p>
In addition to these, further work is planned around tracking and 
reporting clinical observations / vital signs, and supporting 
remote consultations / telehealth.
