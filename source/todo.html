<h2>Open Issues</h2>

<p>
There are a number of issues in which input based on implementation experience is specifically
sought during the trial use phase:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="conformance.html#dstu">Conformance</a>: How system profiles are used</li>
 <li><a href="order.html#dstu">Order</a>: The need for additional kinds of order to be defined</li>
 <li><a href="managing.html#dstu">Resource Identification</a>: Managing resource identification in distributed systems</li>
 <li><a href="search.html#dstu">Query / Search</a>: How should text search be standardized?</li>
 <li><a href="search.html#dstu-2">Query / Search</a>: How much should _include be standardized?</li>
 <li><a href="security-labels.html#dstu">Security Labels</a>: How much policy can be standardized, and how does this impact on this specification?</li>
 <li><a href="security.html#dstu">Security</a>: What use cases are there for digital signatures?</li>
 <li><a href="messaging.html#dstu">Messaging</a>: Messaging has not yet been well-exercised at connectathon, so feedback based on implementation is welcome</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, there are future proposed resources:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A notification resource for creating and recording notifications between parties</li>
 <li>An alarm resource to represent current issues with the patient</li>
 <li>A person resource to support person registries</li>
 <li>An appointment resource for making and tracking arrangements around the future of care</li>
 <li>Payment related resources, and specifically, an Account resource for payment tracking</li>
 <li>Possibly a way to define particular queries (finer detail than Profile provides)</li>
 <li>One or more resources for Advance Care Directive / Power of Attorney</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that other resources beyond these may be anticipated.
</p>
<p>
In addition to these, further work is planned around tracking and 
reporting clinical observations / vital signs, and supporting 
remote consultations / telehealth.
