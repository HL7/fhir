<h2>Outstanding Issues</h2>

<p>
This pages summarizes the known outstanding issues and todo notes currently found in the FHIR specification. 
Most of these issues (thought not all) are noted through out the specification in the appropriate location.
Many of these questions are under investigation during the current connectathon cycle parallel to the ballot.

<p>
Note that adding additional resources is an ongoing process - see <a href="resourcelist.html#adding">notes here</a> (bottom of the page).
