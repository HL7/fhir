<p>
Note that the reference implementations are generally limited to code for representing the 
resource contents in their native form and parsing and serializing them as 
XML and JSON. Some of the implementations provide support for 
building, using and reasoning with resource definitions. A few implementations include
a client that conforms to the RESTful API.
</p>
<p>
Full blown open source implementations for FHIR, some of which use these reference implementations, are
listed on the <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Open_Source_FHIR_implementations">HL7 wiki</a>.
</p>
<p>
It is not necessary to use these particular implementations in order to be conformant. Any other approach 
may be used, including code generated from the schemas.
