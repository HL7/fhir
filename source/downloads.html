<hr/>
<p>
Note that the reference implementations are generally limited to code for representing the 
resource contents in their native form and parsing &amp; serializing them as 
XML and JSON. Some of the implementations provide support for 
building, using and reasoning with resource definitions. A few implementations include
a client that conforms to the RESTful API.
</p>
<p>
Full blown open source implementations for FHIR, some of which use these reference implementations, are
listed on the <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Open_Source_FHIR_implementations">HL7 wiki</a>.
</p>
<p>
It is not necessary to use these particular implementations in order to be conformant. Any other approach 
may be used, including code generated from the schemas.
