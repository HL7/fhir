<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
Each resource may belong to one or more logical compartments. A compartment is a logical 
grouping of resources which share a common property. Compartments have two principal roles:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Function as an access mechanism for finding a set of related resources quickly</li>
 <li>Provide a definitional basis for applying access control to resources quickly</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each compartment definition is associated with exactly one FHIR resource type, identified
by <code>CompartmentDefinition.code</code>.  The compartment also identifies all resources
that are members of the compartment and what search parameters are used to determine membership.
A compartment instance (the set of all resources tied to the 'compartment resource' - a resource
instance of the compartment's type) contains all resources found by searching using the
associated search parameters with a value of the compartment resource.  For example, the
compartment for <code>Patient/123</code> would include <code>Account?subject=Patient/123</code>,
<code>AllergyIntolerance?patient=Patient/123</code>, <code>AllergyIntolerance?asserter=Patient/123</code>, 
etc. Resources may also be included in a compartment based on rules stated in <code>CompartmentDefinition.resource.documentation</code>,
though the lack of a computable representation of the inclusion rules means there may be inconsistency in implementation.
</p>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
At present, CompartmentDefinition instances can <i>only</i> be defined by HL7 International in this 
specification.  This is because their existence creates significant impact on the behavior of servers.
The CompartmentDefinitions defined  in this specification may be hosted on other servers. There is
no computable mechanism to describe a given server's compartment implementation (e.g. resources not
supported in the implementation of the compartment or additional resources included in the compartment).
</li>
<li>
Although compartment definitions can be a useful foundation for access control, they may 
not be sufficient for this purpose.  Resources outside the compartment might 
still be appropriate to be made available or subject to compartment restrictions even 
though they are not formally part of the compartment (see below about access rules).
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2> 
<p>
Compartment definitions describe how particular compartment instances are named and identified,
and how systems know which resources are in the compartment. The following compartments are 
defined by this specification:
</p>
<%compartmentlist%>
<p>
The full definitions of these compartments are published as <code>CompartmentDefinition</code>
resources. Servers typically do not support the full definition of a compartment, and are not 
required to. Systems may publish <code>CompartmentDefinition</code> resources so that
other systems may make use of compartments properly.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>CompartmentDefinitions are used by <a href="capabilitystatement.html">CapabilityStatement</a> instances for specifying how resources are accessed</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://build.fhir.org/HL7/api-incubator/StructureDefinition-GraphDefinition">GraphDefinition</a> also provides a mechanism for grouping resources, though it does not provide an additional search mechanism.
 Inclusion of resources in a <a href="http://build.fhir.org/HL7/api-incubator/StructureDefinition-GraphDefinition">GraphDefinition</a> supports more complex criteria for inclusion than that allowed by CompartmentDefinition.</li>
