  Requirements = Need to know where in the patient history to file/present this report
  Comments = If the diagnostic procedure was performed on the patient, this is the time it was performed. If there are specimens, the diagnostically relevant time can be derived from the specimen collection times, but the specimen information is not always available, and the exact relationship between the specimens and the diagnostically relevant time is not always automatic.

  Comments = ImagingStudy and ImageManifest and the image element are somewhat overlapping - typically, the list of image references in the image element will also be found in one of the imaging study resources.
