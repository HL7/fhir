<p>
A diagnostic report is used for the set of information that is typically provided by a diagnostic service 
when investigations are complete. The information includes a mix of atomic results, text reports, images,
and codes. The mix varies depending on the nature of the diagnostic procedure, and sometimes on the nature
of the outcomes for a particular investigation. 
</p>
<p>
The Diagnostic Report Resource is suitable for the following kinds of Diagnostic Reports:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Laboratory (Clinical Chemistry, Hematology, Microbiology, etc.)</li>
 <li>Pathology / Histopathology / related disciplines</li>
 <li>Imaging Investigations (x-ray, CT, MRI etc.)</li>
 <li>Other diagnostics - Cardiology, Gastroenterology etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Diagnostic Report is not intended to support:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Cumulative Result presentation</li>
 <li>Genetic Sequencing and related reports</li>
</ul>
<p>
Comments on the suitability of this resource and/or requirements analysis for that would be welcome 
through the community input above.

<p>
The actual atomic result data are delegated to the <a href="observation.htm">common Observation
Resource</a> to make it easier to reuse them in a wider context. 
</p>
<p>
There is a wide variety of names associated with the various parts of a diagnostic report. Doctors 
request for "tests" or "results" to be done. What the diagnostic service returns is variously called
the "tests" or "results" or the "report". The individual data items are called "results" or "tests"
both collectively and individually. Collections of individual data items are sometimes called "batteries"
or "panels", which have various implications in different contexts. The naming confusion is worsened 
because of the wide variety of forms that the result of a diagnostic investigation can take, as 
described above. Languages other than English have their own variations on this theme.
</p>
<p>
This resource uses one particular set of terms. A practitioner "requests" a set of "tests". The
diagnostic service returns a "report" which contains a "narrative" - a written summary of the 
outcomes, and "results" - the individual pieces of atomic data. The results are assembled
in a "group" which is a nested structure that can be used to define relationships between
the individual data items.
