			Endpoint.period is meant to represent the general <b>planned</b> period of time when the Endpoint may be used, for example when an endpoint is being commissioned or decommissioned.
			It is not meant to account for temporary downtimes or other short terms changes of availability.<br/>
			For example, if an Endpoint is only available during business hours (9-5), the lack of availability during the night would not be reflected in Endpoint.period.
