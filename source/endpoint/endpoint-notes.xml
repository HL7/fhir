		<li>The IHE connection types that were defined in R4 have been moved to IHE defined profiles and vocabulary at <a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/mCSD">https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/mCSD</a></li>

			Endpoint.period is meant to represent the general <b>planned</b> period of time when the Endpoint may be used, for example when an endpoint is being commissioned or decommissioned.
			It is not meant to account for temporary downtimes or other short terms changes of availability.<br/>
			For example, if an Endpoint is only available during business hours (9-5), the lack of availability during the night would not be reflected in Endpoint.period.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Payload Advertising</h3>
	<p>
		The <code>Endpoint.payload.type</code> is intended to be a description of the semantic content, for example, does this endpoint support exchanging care plans, discharge summaries, referrals, appointment bookings, etc.
		The "how" that content is exchanged is described elsewhere, via the <code>mimeType</code> (what format) and <code>connectionType</code> (what exchange method).
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>Endpoint.profileCanonical</code>/<code>profileUri</code> describes the detailed type of content that is handles/available at the endpoint. (Such as canonicals of FHIR resource profiles, or other non-fhir based profile references)
