<h2>HL7 Version 3 (and ISO 21090)</h2>
<a name="V3"> </a>
<p>
HL7 Version 3 (V3) is the next generation of HL7's messaging standards.  It introduced 
a common Reference Information Model (RIM), data type model and set of vocabulary as well as 
a formal standards development methodology.  In addition, it introduced the use of 
"documents" as an alternative architecture to messaging for sharing healthcare information 
(see <a href="comparison-cda.html">the CDA comparison</a>).  While nominally covering both, the term "V3" is 
typically used to refer to "V3 messaging".  The data types used as a basis for V3 have 
also been adopted by ISO as ISO 21090.  The HL7 RIM has also 
been adopted as an ISO standard.
</p>
<p>
V3 messaging has been adopted by a number of large projects, particularly in the 
electronic health record area, though it has not achieved the market penetration of 
HL7 V2.  The HL7 RIM and the ISO 21090 data types have also been 
used by other SDOs and projects that have not leveraged the full HL7 V3 methodology.  
Most of the comments and guidance provided here will apply to those solutions as well.
</p>

<h3>V3 Similarities and Differences</h3>
<p>
<b>Reference model:</b> The use of the HL7 RIM is a core aspect 
of the HL7 V3 methodology and it is front and center in the specification and the wire 
format.  All data elements in HL7 V3 instances are derived from either the RIM or the ISO 
data types.  In FHIR, this is true of most resources and data type elements, but not all.  
Some resources (<a href="profile.html">Profile</a>, <a href="conformance.html">Conformance</a>, 
<a href="valueset.html">ValueSet</a>, etc.) deal with content that is outside the RIM's scope.  And in a few circumstances, adjustments have been made in 
the FHIR data types that are not yet supported in the HL7 V3 data types model.  The expectation 
is that these changes will be supported in the next version of the V3 data types model.  The 
main difference is that the wire format of FHIR is not driven by the RIM 
mappings.  This results in considerably more concise and intuitive instances.  It is possible 
to implement FHIR with absolutely no knowledge of the HL7 RIM.
</p>
<p>
<b>Codes:</b> V3 places considerable reliance on coded attributes to convey the 
meaning of instances.  Examples include <i>classCode</i>, <i>moodCode</i>, <i>determinerCode</i>, 
etc.  
The allowed codes for these attributes are strictly controlled by HL7.  FHIR also has attributes 
that are limited to codes defined in the FHIR specification - those using the <a href="datatypes.html#code">code</a> 
data type.  However, these are generally limited to attributes with business meaning - status, contact types, etc.
</p>
<p>Both FHIR and V3 make use of value sets to define the sets of codes that can be used for 
attributes in particular contexts.  However, in FHIR, a <a href="valueset.html">ValueSet</a> 
is just another type of resource, meaning it can be sent as part of an instance just like any
 other piece of data.  (The same is true of <a href="profile.html">Profile</a>, <a href="conformance.html">Conformance</a> 
 and other meta-level resources.)</p>
<p>
<b>Granularity &amp; referencing:</b> HL7 V3 models are broken into 3 main types - wrappers, 
payloads and Common Message Element Types (CMETs).  These are combined into interactions to 
define the set of content that can be sent over the wire at one time.  In some cases, the 
granularity of each of these models will exactly align with the granularity of FHIR resources, 
but not always.  V3 models are divided based on the expectation of re-use.  FHIR models are 
divided based on whether the objects they represent are considered to be able to "stand alone".  
In HL7 V3, numerous models can exist to represent the same essential underlying healthcare 
information construct.  For example, at the HL7 International level, there are 10 different CMETs 
for the concept of "Patient".  In addition, some payload models represent patient directly without 
using CMETs.  Further variation exists in the V3 models created by HL7 affiliates and other V3 
implementers.  Each of these different CMETs has their own schema and may use different element names, 
different levels of nesting and different constraints.  With FHIR, there is only one <a href="patient.html">Patient</a> resource.  
Many profiles can be created on that resource, but all of them will use the same schema and support the same wire format.
</p>
<p>
<b>Design by constraint:</b> The design methodology in V3 is one of "design by constraint".  
The idea is that all data needed for any sort of healthcare communication is represented in the HL7 RIM.  
All other data models simply constrain the RIM to reflect the needs of particular domain spaces.  
This starts at the international level with further refinement happening in individual countries, projects 
and finally specific implementations.  As models become closer to the implementer, they become less abstract.  
The result is a tendency for V3 models to be extremely broad in their coverage and capability and also 
somewhat abstract.  They need to be in order to ensure that all possible implementations in the space 
covered by that model can be proper constraints on it.  As well, each model produces its own schema and, 
in most cases, constrained schemas are not strictly wire-compatible with the schemas of the model being 
constrained.
</p>
<p>FHIR takes a different approach.  FHIR resources do not attempt to represent all data elements that 
could possibly be used in a space.  Instead, only those data elements that are expected to be used by 
"most" implementations within the scope of the resource are considered part of the core resource definition.  
(This is sometimes referred to as "The 80% rule" - if approximately 80% of systems maintaining the resource 
will support the element, then it is part of core).  All other data elements are expected to be handled 
using extensions.  <a href="profile.html">Profiles</a> are used both to constrain resources and to define 
extensions appropriate to narrower implementation spaces.  Wire format interoperability is retained across 
all profiles on a given resource.</p>
<p>
<b>Context conduction:</b> When conveying healthcare information between humans, much data can be inferred 
from context.  For example, if a report has an "author" noted on a cover page, it is generally inferred that 
each statement within the report is authored by that same person.  This inference grows more challenging when 
data needs to be analyzed by computers, whether for query, decision support or other analysis.  Thus far, the 
HL7 V3 methodology has provided three distinct mechanisms to allow data models to define how "context" should 
propagate through models, making explicit for computers what humans would normally understand intuitively.  
FHIR has chosen a different path.  In FHIR, no context is conducted - everything is explicit.  If a report 
about a patient contains 100 observations all about that same patient, each observation will include a reference 
to the patient.  However, this is relatively painless because it's only a reference - an id and possibly a short 
display value.  One of the benefits of this approach is that each resource can be safely consumed and examined 
without concern for the context in which that resource was communicated.  The meaning of each resource instance 
is fully self-contained.
</p>
<p>
<b>Null flavors:</b> In healthcare, it's quite common for data to be unknown, unavailable, have an exceptional
value or otherwise fall outside the bounds of a "normal" value.  To deal with this, V3 introduced the 
concept of "null flavor" on almost every attribute and data type property in its models.  These coded null flavors 
could be sent in place of or in addition to the data that would typically be sent for the attribute, association or 
data type property.  Examples include the ideas of "Unknown", "Not asked", "Positive infinity", "Trace amount", 
"Masked", "Other", etc.  Unless an element was explicitly marked as "mandatory" - meaning no null flavors were 
permitted, these null flavors could appear absolutely anywhere.
</p>
<p>
FHIR approached the problem differently.  Null flavors are only introduced in the core specification in those 
circumstances where it is expected that most systems will need them.  Where needed, the flavors are constrained 
to those relevant to that element.
</p>

<h3>V3 Interoperability Considerations</h3>
<a name="V3-interoperability"> </a>
<p>
<b>Using RIM mappings:</b> Most resource elements and data type properties include mappings to the RIM.  These 
mappings serve two purposes.  They help to define FHIR semantics in terms of HL7's reference models, helping to 
ensure that the Work Groups defining the data elements have a good and consistent understanding of the meaning of 
every element.  They also provide guidance for implementers of version 3 specifications that may be looking to migrate 
to or map between version 3 and FHIR.  However, for the latter use it's important to understand some limitations on 
the RIM mappings.  The RIM is a language which allows the same "idea" to be conveyed in a number of different ways 
with varying granularity and expressiveness.  Thus it's entirely possible for a RIM element to map to a core FHIR 
element even though its RIM representation is somewhat different than described in the mapping.  In addition, not all 
V3 models adhere to good modeling practices, so some data elements that would appear to map to a FHIR element might
not map if the information has not been well represented.  Therefore RIM mappings should be taken as a guide, 
not an absolute, and mappings must be done in the context of the V3 specification being mapped.  (Also 
see <a href="#V3-abstractModels">Abstract models</a> below.)
</p>
<p>
<b>V3 extensions:</b> While the core of the V3 methodology is "design by constraint", it still makes provision 
for the use of extensions - either in a foreign namespace or denoted by a special attribute.  When converting
between V3 and FHIR, the use of such extensions will need to be taken into account.  As a rule, most V3 extensions 
will map to FHIR extensions, as the V3 design-by-constraint principle suggests that anything that would qualify as 
"core" in FHIR would already have been part of the base V3 specification.
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstract models:</b><a name="V3-abstractModels"> </a>As previously noted, many of the V3 models created at the 
HL7 International level are quite abstract.  As a result, the models can be used to say a wide variety of things, 
often in a wide variety of different ways.  This makes defining a mapping between those specifications and FHIR 
(or any other specification) quite tricky.  For practical V3 &lt;-&gt; FHIR interoperability, mappings will need to be 
created at the level of message specifications, implementation guides and/or templates that are more concrete and 
closer to the implementation level.  For example, mapping all of CDA to FHIR would be impossible given the expressive 
capability of the right-hand-side of the CDA model.  However, mapping the Consolidated CDA (CCDA) templates to FHIR 
is quite possible.
</p>
<p>
<b>Context conduction:</b> As discussed above, HL7 V3 models rely on context conduction - either implicitly or 
explicitly controlled.  When converting to FHIR, the context will need to be propagated into each resource.
</p>
<p>
<b>Update mode:</b> In HL7 V3 instances, updates are generally handled in snapshot mode, similar to the FHIR 
approach - if any information changes, the entire record is sent, including the modified data elements.  However, 
the V3 methodology does support the introduction of an "updateMode" property to allow only the changes to be sent 
for all or part of an instance.  Each element repetition is flagged with an updateMode to indicate whether the 
element is to be added, removed, updated, etc.  Additional updateModes allow further control over updates.  As 
with the <a href="comparison-v2.html#V2-updateMode">V2 discussion</a> above, implementers will need to generate a full snapshot of 
each resource or will need to introduce modifier extensions to allow similar behavior to V3.
</p>
<p>
<b>Additional considerations:</b> Most of the implementation considerations for interoperating between FHIR and 
V2 also hold with V3.  Specifically: <a href="comparison-v2.html#V2-extensions">Extensions</a>, <a href="comparison-v2.html#V2-contained">Independent vs. 
Contained resources</a>, <a href="comparison-v2.html#V2-identification">Resource Identification</a>, <a href="comparison-v2.html#V2-merging">Merging 
references and resources</a> and <a href="comparison-v2.html#V2-humanReadable">Generating human-readable content</a>.
