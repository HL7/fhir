<h1>Messaging using FHIR Resources</h1>

<p>
FHIR Resources can be used in a traditional messaging context, much like HL7 v2. 
Applications asserting conformance to this framework claim to be conformant to "FHIR messaging". 
</p>

<p>
In FHIR messaging, a "request message" is sent from a source application to a destination
application when an event happens. Events mostly correspond to things that happen in the 
real world. The request message consists of a <a href="extras.html#bundle">bundle</a>
<a href="extras.html#tags">identified by the tag</a> "http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/message", 
with the first resource in the bundle being a <a href="messageheader.html">MessageHeader</a> 
resource. The MessageHeader resource has a code - the message event - that identifies the 
nature of the request message, and it alslo carries additional request metadata. 
The other resources in the bundle depend on the type of the request.
</p>
<p>
The events supported in FHIR, along with the resources that are included in them, are defined below. 
</p>
<p>
The destination application processes the request and returns one or more response messages 
which are also a <a href="extras.html#bundle">bundle</a> of resources
<a href="extras.html#tags">identified by the tag</a> "http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/message", with the first 
resource in the bundle being a <a href="messageheader.html">MessageHeader</a> resource with a response
section that reports the outcome of processing the message and any additional response 
resources required. 
</p>

<h2>Basic Messaging Assumptions</h2>

<p>
This specification assumes that content will be delivered from one application
to another by some delivery mechanism, and then a response will be returned 
to the source application. The exact mechanism of transfer is irrelevant to
this specification, but may include file transfer, http based transfer, MLLP
(HL7 minimal lower layer protocol), MQ series messaging or anything else. 
The only requirement for the transfer layer is that requests are sent to 
a known location and responses are returned to the source of the request. 
This specification considers the source and destination applications as logical
entities, and the mapping from logical source and destination to implementation
specific addresses is outside the scope of this specification, though this 
specification does provide a direct delivery mechanism below.
</p>

<p>
In principle, source applications are not required to wait for a response to 
a transaction before issuing a new transaction. However in many cases, the 
messages in a given stream are dependent on each other, and must be sent and 
processed in order. In addition, some transfer methods may require sequential 
delivery of messages.
</p>

<p>
This specification assumes that content will be delivered from one application to 
another by some delivery mechanism, and then one or more responses will be returned 
to the source application. The agreements around the content of the messages and
the behavior of the two applications the "contract" that describes the exchange.
The contract will add regional and local agreements to the rules defined in this 
specification.
</p>
<p>
This specification ignores the existence of interface engines and message 
transfer agents that exist between the <i>source</i> and <i>destination</i>. 
Either they are transparent to the message/transaction content and irrelevant 
to this specification, or they are actively involved in manipulating the message 
content (in particular, the source and destination headers are often changed). 
If these middleware agents are modifying the message content, then they become
responsible for honoring the contract that applies (including applicable profiles) 
in both directions.

<h3>Synchronicity</h3>
<p>
ToDO: Synchronicity
</p>

<h3>Message Identifiers</h3>
<p>
An incoming message contains two identifiers: the envelope id 
(<a href="extras.html#bundles">feed</a>.id) and the <a href="messageheader.html">message</a>.identifier. 
Each time a new message is created, it SHALL be assigned an identifier that is 
unique within that message stream. Note that since message streams are often 
merged with other streams, it is recommended that the identifier should be globally 
unique. This can be achieved by using a UUID or an OID or appropriately 
chosen URI with a serially incrementing number. Each time a message is sent, 
the bundle identifier (feed.id) should be changed to a new value. 
</p>
<p>
When a receiver receives and processes the message, it responds with a 
new message with a new identifier, wrapped in a bundle which also has a new id. 
The response message also quotes the request message identifier so that the source
system can relate the response to its request.
</p>

<a name="reliable"> </a>
<h3>Absence of Reliable Messaging</h3>
<p>
Some of the message delivery mechanisms mentioned above are reliable delivery
systems - the message is always delivered, or an appropriate error is returned
to the source. However most implementations use methods which do not provide
reliable messaging, and either the request or the response can get lost in transit.
FHIR messaging describes a simple approach that receivers should conform to in 
order to handle the absence of reliable messaging that maintains predictable 
functionality.
</p>
<p>
When considering the issue of reliable messaging, the source application 
should consider whether the message is a message of consequence, or 
a message of currency. A message of consequence is one where the message
requests a change that should not be processed more than once, and where
the sender needs the response that results from processing the message.
A message of currency is where the correct response is the very latest 
information available. Typically, this is status information. Some 
messages fit into neither category - the response does not particularly
matter. Usually these are notification messages.
</p>
<p>
In order to enable these processing rules, and to benefit from them, the 
original sender of the message SHALL do the following when it receives
no response to a message within a configured timeout period:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>Consequence</td><td>Resend the same message (including with the same identifier) with the same envelope id</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Currency</td><td>Resend the same message (including with the same identifier) with a different envelope id</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Neither</td><td>Resend the same message (including with the same identifier) with a different envelope id</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
When a receiver declares that it implements reliable answers, it SHALL check the 
incoming envelope id and message identifier against a cache of previously received messages. 
The correct action to take depends on what is received:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>Both the envelope id and message identifier have not been received</td><td>This is the normal case, and the message should be processed</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Both envelope and message already received</td><td>The original response has been lost (failed to return to the request issuer), and the original response SHALL be resent</td></tr>
 <tr><td>The message identifier has already been received, but the envelope id is new</td><td>A previously seen message has been resubmitted for processing again. The server may either reprocess the message, or reject the message</td></tr>
 <tr><td>The envelope id has already been received, but the message identifier is new</td><td>This is an error - envelope ids should never be reused</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The duration period for caching does generally not need to be very long. At a minimum, it 
could be 1 minute longer than the timeout of the sending system, though it may need to 
be longer depending on the re-sending policies of the sending system.

<h2>Conformance Statement</h2>
<p>
Applications may only assert conformance to "FHIR messaging" if they 
publish a conformance statement so the claim may be verified. A 
conformance statement lists all the message events supported (either 
as sender or receiver) and for each event, a 
profile that states which resources are bundled (sender), or 
are required to be bundled (receiver), and any rules about the 
information content of the individual resources. The conformance 
statement is a <a href="conformance.html">resource with the name 
"Conformance"</a>. 
</p>

<a name="mailbox"></a>
<h2>Mailbox</h2>
<p>
The mailbox is the standard name for a service hosted on a <a href="http.html">RESTful server</a> that accepts messages and processes 
them as transactions and returns a message response appropriate for the message received. The server is under
no obligation to do anything particular with the resources except as required by the semantics of the event code in the 
message resource. A server may choose to retain the resources and make them available on a RESTful interface, but 
is not required to do so. If the server returns 200 Ok, it SHALL return a valid message that indicates what the outcome
of the event processing is. An HTTP error indicates that the message was not processed successfully and that it should
be resubmitted (and doing so should not result in a duplicate message response).  Repeated failures indicate either a
fatal problem with the message or a problem with the receiving application.
</p>
<p>
The mailbox can also be used to accept queries or documents. In the case of documents, the document is "accepted" (the server 
takes responsibility for custody of the received document) and an HTTP status of 204 No Content is returned, 
or an HTTP error is returned. The server is under no obligation to perform any particular processing of the document except as 
specific trading partner agreements dictate. In the case of queries, the server a bundle containing 
a query and a set of other related resources, processes the query, and returns a bundle with a query which is a response,
and any additional resources that are part of the query response.
</p>
<p>
The following rules apply to the mailbox:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The mailbox only accepts POST transactions - any other HTTP method will result in an HTTP error</li>
 <li>The request content type submitted is always <a href="extras.html#bundle">a bundle</a> containing a message or document resource as the first resource</li>
 <li>The response content type returned is always an HTTP error, <a href="extras.html#bundle">a bundle</a> containing a message as the first resource, or empty (if a document was received)</li>
 <li>If the response is an error, the body SHOULD be an <a href="operationoutcome.html">Errors &amp; Warning</a> resource with full details</li> 
 <li>The URL never takes any parameters</li>
 <li>The mailbox may be authenticated using standard HTTP authentication methods, including OAuth</li>
</ul>
<p>
This simple mailbox profile can be used by any HTTP end point that accepts FHIR messages or documents, not just 
FHIR RESTful servers.
</p>
<p>
In order to ensure consistency of processing, the <a href="#reliable">logical rules regarding processing of envelope id and 
message id described above</a> SHALL be followed when messages are processed using the mailbox. No such rules apply regarding
documents - if the client receives no response, it should continue to submit the document until it does. Servers SHALL 
accept multiple document submissions and process them correctly.
</p>

<h2>Relationship between Messaging and REST</h2>

<p>
As well as this messaging framework documented here, FHIR also defines a 
<a href="http.html">RESTful API</a>. The messaging and RESTful frameworks
are related in that both share the same set of resources on which they operate.
In fact, the basic <a href="messageheader.html">MessageHeader</a> resource 
that the messaging framework is implemented is itself a resource that can treated in a RESTful approach. 
</p>
<p>
The kinds of functionality that the RESTful API and the messaging framework
offer are very similar; their primary difference is architectural in nature. 
</p>
<p>
For instance, the messaging framework defines an event for notifying that
a administration resource has been created or updated, as does the REST API.
On the other hand, there are differences in the capabilities offered - while
a patient merge can be implemented as a series of RESTful operations performed
by the client that update all resources linked to the patient, when a message 
command to merge patient records are all is processed, the server will do all
the work, and is also able to merge in areas not exposed on the RESTful API.
The REST API, however, provides a set of basic operations on all resources
that would need special definitions in the messaging framework - definitions that
are not provided.
</p>
<p>
There is no expectation that RESTful systems will need to offer messaging
support, or vice versa, though systems may find it useful to support both 
sets of functionality in order to satisfy a wider range of implementers. 
</p>
<p>
As a resource that can be used with the RESTful framework, the messaging
resource has the normal resource end-point ([base-url]/Message), which is
used to manage a set of static messages resources. This could be used to 
make an archive of past messages available. <b>Creating or updating Message resources
in this fashion does not represent the actual occurrence of any event, nor can it trigger
any logic associated with the actual event.</b> It is just for managing a set of message resources.
</p>
<p>
In, addition, as described above, this specification defines the mailbox ([base-url]/Mailbox)
so that RESTful servers can offer both messaging and RESTful services at once.
Alternatively, messages can be transported between systems using any other method by which 
a stream of bytes (the message bundle) can be moved from one place to 
another. There is no requirement to use HTTP.

<a name="Events"></a>
<a name="events"></a>
<h2>Event List</h2>

<p>
The <i>message.code</i> element carries a <a href="datatypes.html#Coding">Coding</a> that identifies the event that the message conveys. 
This table lists the message event codes defined in this specification (the system value for these is "http://hl7.org/fhir/message-type"):
</p>

[%events%]

<p>
In this table, the request and response columns list the focus resource for the event, along with other resources that should also be carried in the message directly (if they exist).
Additional events may be defined elsewhere, though this specification does not yet define how. DSTU: Input on this is sought during the trial use period.
