<h1>Messaging using FHIR Resources</h1>

<p>
FHIR Resources can be used in a traditional messaging context, much like HL7 v2.
Applications asserting conformance to this framework claim to be conformant to "FHIR messaging".
</p>

<p>
In FHIR messaging, a "request message" is sent from a source application to a destination
application when an event happens. Events mostly correspond to things that happen in the
real world. The request message consists of a <a href="bundle.html">Bundle</a> identified
by the <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.type">type</a> "message",
with the first resource in the bundle being a <a href="messageheader.html">MessageHeader</a>
resource. The MessageHeader resource has a code - the message event - that identifies the
nature of the request message, and it also carries additional request metadata.
The other resources in the bundle depend on the type of the request.
</p>
<p>
The events supported in FHIR, along with the resources that are included in them, are defined below.
</p>
<p>
The destination application processes the request and returns one or more response messages
which are also a <a href="bundle.html">bundle</a> of resources identified
by the <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.type">type</a> "message", with the first
resource in each bundle being a <a href="messageheader.html">MessageHeader</a> resource with a response
section that reports the outcome of processing the message and any additional response
resources required.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Example Request Message: TODO <!-- <a href="query-example-request.xml.html">XML</a> or <a href="query-example-request.json.html">JSON</a> --></li>
 <li>Example Response Message: TODO <!-- <a href="query-example-response.xml.html">XML</a> or <a href="query-example-response.json.html">JSON</a> --></li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic Messaging Assumptions</h2>

<p>
This specification assumes that content will be delivered from one application to
another by some delivery mechanism, and then one or more responses will be returned
to the source application. The exact mechanism of transfer is irrelevant to
this specification, but may include file transfer, http based transfer, MLLP
(HL7 minimal lower layer protocol), MQ series messaging or anything else.
The only requirement for the transfer layer is that requests are sent to
a known location and responses are returned to the source of the request.
This specification considers the source and destination applications as logical
entities, and the mapping from logical source and destination to implementation
specific addresses is outside the scope of this specification, though this
specification does provide a direct delivery mechanism below.
</p>
<p>
The agreements around the content of the messages and the behavior of the two
applications form the "contract" that describes the exchange. The contract
will add regional and local agreements to the rules defined in this specification.
</p>
<p>
This specification ignores the existence of interface engines and message
transfer agents that exist between the <i>source</i> and <i>destination</i>.
Either they are transparent to the message/transaction content and irrelevant
to this specification, or they are actively involved in manipulating the message
content (in particular, the source and destination headers are often changed).
If these middleware agents are modifying the message content, then they become
responsible for honoring the contract that applies (including applicable profiles)
in both directions.
</p>
<p>
A key aspect of a message is the impact of its content:
</p>
[%codelist http://hl7.org/fhir/vs/message-significance-category%]
<p>
Some Events defined by FHIR are assigned to one of these categories,
but others are not able to be categorized in advance, and the category
must be determined by the content, or the context.
</p>

<a name="synchronous"> </a>
<a name="patterns"> </a>
<h3>Message Exchange Patterns</h3>
<p>
Each FHIR request message has one or more response messages. There must be at least
one response message so that the sender can know that the message was properly
received. Multiple response messages SHALL NOT be returned for messages of consequence,
and SHOULD not be returned for notifications.
</p>
<p>
In principle, source applications are not required to wait for a response to
a transaction before issuing a new transaction. However in many cases, the
messages in a given stream are dependent on each other, and must be sent and
processed in order. In addition, some transfer methods may require sequential
delivery of messages.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, a synchronous exchange pattern - where the sender sends a
message, and waits on the same channel for a single response, and then
sends the next message - is the easiest to understand and manage. The
<a href="#process">$process-message</a> <a href="operations.html">operation</a>
described below works in this fashion.
</p>
<p>
However synchronous message exchange does not cater for multiple response
messages, which may arise when processing queries, and also imposes
through-put limitations which may become relevant at high volumes.
Additionally, it may not be practical or appropriate to wait for
response messages. In these cases, the asynchronous message pattern
<a href="#async">described below</a> should be used.
</p>


<h3>MessageHeader.identifiers</h3>
<p>
An incoming message contains two identifiers: the Bundle.id and
the <a href="messageheader.html">MessageHeader</a>.identifier.
Each time a new message is created, it SHALL be assigned an identifier
(MessageHeader.identifier) that is unique within that message stream.
Note that since message streams are often merged with other streams,
it is recommended that the identifier should be globally unique.
This can be achieved by using a UUID or an OID. Each time a message is sent,
the Bundle.id should be changed to a new value.
</p>
<p>
When a receiver receives and processes the message, it responds with a
new message with a new identifier, wrapped in a bundle which also has a new id.
The response message also quotes the request MessageHeader.identifier so that
the source system can relate the response to its request.
</p>

<a name="reliable"> </a>
<h3>Absence of Reliable Messaging</h3>
<p>
Some of the message delivery mechanisms mentioned above are reliable delivery
systems - the message is always delivered, or an appropriate error is returned
to the source. However most implementations use methods which do not provide
reliable messaging, and either the request or the response can get lost in transit.
FHIR messaging describes a simple approach that receivers SHOULD conform to in
order to handle the absence of reliable messaging that maintains predictable
functionality.
</p>
<p>
If the sender of the message implements reliable messaging, it SHALL do
the following when it receives no response to a message within a
configured timeout period:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>Consequence</td><td>Resend the same message (with the same identifier) with the same Bundle.id</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Currency</td><td>Resend the same message (with the same identifier) with a different Bundle.id</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Notification</td><td>Resend the same message (with the same identifier) with a different Bundle.id</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
When a receiver implements reliable messaging, it SHALL check the incoming Bundle.id
and MessageHeader.identifier against a cache of previously received messages. The
correct action to take depends on what is received:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>Both the Bundle.id and MessageHeader.identifier have not been received</td><td>This is the normal case, and the message should be processed</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Both envelope and message already received</td><td>The original response has been lost (failed to return to the request issuer), and the original response SHALL be resent</td></tr>
 <tr><td>The MessageHeader.identifier has already been received, but the Bundle.id is new</td><td>A previously seen message has been resubmitted for processing again. The server may either reprocess the message, or reject the message</td></tr>
 <tr><td>The Bundle.id has already been received, but the MessageHeader.identifier is new</td><td>This is an error - Bundle.id values should never be reused</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The duration period for caching does generally not need to be very long. At a minimum, it
could be 1 minute longer than the timeout of the sending system, though it may need to
be longer depending on the re-sending policies of the sending system.
</p>
<p>
Applications that implement reliable messaging declare their reliable cache
period in their <a href="conformance.html">conformance statement</a>.
</p>

<h4>Example: Consequence</h4>
<p>
In the first example, a Clinical EHR issues an order for a particular imaging examination
to be performed on a patient. This is considered to be a message of <b>Consequence</b>: multiple
orders should not be created (in practice there are usually human review processes that
catch multiple orders, but repeat orders create entropy in the system that is harmful).
The EHR sends a message where the Bundle.id is UUID 1 (72edc4e0-6708-42ab-9734-f56721882c10),
with a MessageHeader.identifier of UUID 2 (dad53a57-dcb4-4f18-b066-7239eb4b5229).
</p>
<p>
The EHR system never receives a response to the message; it does not know whether the request
message got lost, or the imaging management systems was unable to process the request, or whether
it successfully processed the message and the response was lost. In this case, the EHR system
resends the message with same two identifiers.
</p>
<p>
In this case, the imaging system successfully received the message, and processed it. Because
it receives the resent order after 1 minute (which is within its 15 minute cache time),
and the two UUIDs 1 and 2 match a message it has already processed, it knows that it already
processed the order, and simply returns the previous response. In the case of additional resent
queries, the application keeps sending the original response, though it may also alert system
administrators that the same original message keeps being resent, since lost messages should be
a rare occurrence.
</p>
<p>
When the EHR system finally receives the message, it knows how the imaging management system
responded; it can be sure because the message id from the original request is echoed in the
response portion of the returned message.
</p>


<h4>Example: Currency</h4>
<p>
In this second example, a Clinical EHR needs to know what appointment slots are available
for a particular imaging procedure. This is a message of <b>Currency</b>: available slots are
ever disappearing, and ordering a slot that has become unavailable is a waste of time for
the humans and systems involved. The EHR sends a message where the Bundle.id is
UUID 3 (4c7f5cb2-5964-4d42-b719-e0227461818c), with a MessageHeader.identifier is
UUID 4 (63ed7d68-b2cc-421d-ba1c-a6c7785581f2).
</p>
<p>
The EHR system never receives a response to the message; it does not know whether the request
message got lost, or the imaging management systems was unable to process the request, or whether
it successfully processed the message and the response was lost. In this case, the EHR system
resends the message with same MessageHeader.identifier (UUID 4), but creates a new Bundle.id (c7c17fe4-9560-49c7-b2ae-42636476fb86).
</p>
<p>
In this case, the imaging system successfully received the message, and processed it. When
it receives the resent order after 1 minute (which is within its 15 minute cache time), it
sees that although the message id is the same, the Bundle.id has changed, and it reprocesses
the message again, and sends a new response.
</p>
<p>
When the EHR system finally receives the message, it knows the current slot availability
on the imaging management system responded.
</p>
<p>
Note that the existence of active intermediaries (or "middleware") creates the need
for this protocol - the original sender matches the response to the request based on the
MessageHeader.identifier, and so an active intermediary that choose the re-initiate a query that
it previously relayed cannot change the MessageHeader.identifier. This protocol avoids the need for
the MessageHeader.identifier to change, and only requires change to the Bundle.id which is never
the basis for context linking outside the immediate message exchange protocol described
here.
</p>


<h2>Conformance Statement</h2>
<p>
Applications may only assert conformance to "FHIR messaging" if they
publish a conformance statement so the claim may be verified. A
conformance statement lists all the message events supported (either
as sender or receiver) and for each event, a
profile that states which resources are bundled (sender), or
are required to be bundled (receiver), and any rules about the
information content of the individual resources. The conformance
statement is a <a href="conformance.html">resource with the name
"Conformance"</a>.
</p>

<a name="process"></a>
<h2>$process-message</h2>
<p>
The simplest way to handle messages where there are also <a href="http.html">RESTful interactions</a>
occurring is to use the <a href="messageheader-operations.html">$process-message</a>. 
This operation that accept a messages, processes it according to the definition of the event in the message header, and returns a one or more response messages. 
e.g. In addition to processing the message event, a server
may choose to retain all or some the resources and make them available on a RESTful interface, but
is not required to do so.
</p>
<p>
When processing messages, a server may return a status code of 200 OK, or an process/error code (300+).
If the server returns 200 OK, it SHALL return a bundle that is the message response.
For any other response code, the message has not been succesfully processed. The server MAY return an
<a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome</a> with additional information, and SHOULD
do so if the response code is 400 or greater.
The client SHALL interpret a 4xx response to indicate that there is no point resubmitting the unaltered
message, and a 5xx response to indicate an unexpected error occurred on the part of the server, with
the implication that it may be appropriate to resubmit the original message. Doing so SHOULD NOT result 
in a duplicate message response). Repeated failures indicate either a fatal problem with the submission 
or a problem with the receiving application.
</p>
<p>
The following rules apply when using $process-message:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The operation only accepts POST transactions - any other HTTP method will result in an HTTP error</li>
 <li>The request content type submitted is always <a href="bundle.html">a Bundle</a> with type "message" containing a <a href="messageheader.html">Message Header</a> resource as the first resource</li>
 <li>The response content type returned is always <a href="bundle.html">a Bundle</a> with type "message" containing a <a href="messageheader.html">Message Header</a> resource as the first resource, or an HTTP error</li>
 <li>If the response is an error, the body SHOULD be an <a href="operationoutcome.html">Errors &amp; Warning</a> resource with full details</li>
 <li>The mailbox may be authenticated using standard HTTP authentication methods, including OAuth</li>
</ul>
<p>
The $process-message operation can be used by any HTTP end point that accepts FHIR messages, not just FHIR RESTful servers.
</p>
<p>
In order to ensure consistency of processing, the <a href="#reliable">logical rules regarding processing of Bundle.id and
message id described above</a> SHALL be followed when messages are processed using this operation. 
</p>

<p>
The <a href="messageheader-operations.html">$process-message</a> operation may be used 
synchronously, or asynchronously.
</p>
<h3>Synchronous Operation</h3>
<p>
Synchronous messaging is the easiest to understand; the sender sends a message to the 
receiver (the server), the server processes it, and then returns a response. Usually
(though not always) the sender waits for the response to the current message before  
sending the next message. This kind of messaging exchange is the most common because
it's the simplest to understand.
</p>
<p>
The following rules apply when using the $process-message operation synchronously:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The URL (http://server/base/$process-message) has no parameters</li>
 <li>It is an error if the sender POSTs a message that requires multiple response messages</li>
 <li>Servers SHALL accept multiple concurrent message submissions and process them correctly (they are allowed to process them sequentially internally, but multiple concurrent submissions is not an error in it's own right)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asynchronous Operation</h3>
<p>
in Asynchronous messaging, the server acknowledges receipt of them message immediately,
and responds to the sender separately. The server may respond more than once to any
given message. 
</p>
<p>
The following rules apply when using the $process-message operation synchronously:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The URL has at least one parameter: http://server/base/$process-message?async=true</li>
 <li>The server acknowledges the message with a 200OK with no body, or returns an HTTP error if the message cannot be processed. An <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome</a> SHOULD be returned in such a case</li>
 <li>Accepting the message means that the server has understood the message enough to know where to respond</li>
 <li>By default, the server responds by invoking the $process-message using the sender's stated end-point in the message: POST [MessageHeader.source.endpoint]/$process-messages]</li>
 <li>Since the source end point may be manipulated by message transfer engines, an alternative response address may be specified using the parameter "response-url": http://server/base/$process-message?async=true&amp;response-url=http://server2.com/base/anything. 
   The endpoint at the specified URL SHALL implement the signature of the $process-message operation (parameter async=true, accept a Bundle, return a 200 OK or an error)</li>
 <li>The server submits response messages to the appropriate end point with the parameter async=true. There is no response message for the response messages</li>
</ul>
<p>
When a message is received, a receiver can determine from the content of the message header whether it's a new message to process, or a response to a message that has already been sent. 
Note that asynchronous messaging is less reliable than synchronous messaging; more can go wrong. 
This specification does not dictate any particular error handling protocols or responsibilities; these are left to trading partner agreements between implementers.
</p>

<a name="endpoints"></a>
<h2>Relationship between Messaging and REST</h2>

<p>
As well as this messaging framework documented here, FHIR also defines a
<a href="http.html">RESTful API</a>. The messaging and RESTful frameworks
are related in that both share the same set of resources on which they operate.
In fact, the basic <a href="messageheader.html">MessageHeader</a> resource
that the messaging framework is implemented is itself a resource that can treated in a RESTful approach.
</p>
<p>
The kinds of functionality that the RESTful API and the messaging framework
offer are very similar; their primary difference is architectural in nature.
</p>
<p>
For instance, the messaging framework defines an event for notifying that
a administration resource has been created or updated, as does the REST API.
On the other hand, there are differences in the capabilities offered - while
a patient merge can be implemented as a series of RESTful operations performed
by the client that update all resources linked to the patient, when a message
command to merge patient records is processed, the server will do all
the work, and is also able to merge in areas not exposed on the RESTful API.
The REST API, however, provides a set of basic operations on all resources
that would need special definitions in the messaging framework - definitions that
are not provided.
</p>
<p>
There is no expectation that RESTful systems will need to offer messaging
support, or vice versa, though systems may find it useful to support both
sets of functionality in order to satisfy a wider range of implementers.
</p>
<p>
As a resource that can be used with the RESTful framework, the MessageHeader
resource has the normal resource end-point (/MessageHeader), which is
used to manage a set of static message resources. This could be used to
make an archive of past messages available. <b>Creating or updating MessageHeader resources
in this fashion does not represent the actual occurrence of any event, nor can it trigger
any logic associated with the actual event.</b> It is just for managing a set of message header resources.
</p>
<p>
In, addition, as described above, this specification defines the /Mailbox end-point
so that RESTful servers can offer both messaging and RESTful services at once.
Alternatively, messages can be transported between systems using any other method by which
a stream of bytes (the message bundle) can be moved from one place to
another. There is no requirement to use HTTP.
</p>



<a name="Events"></a>
<a name="events"></a>
<h2>Event List</h2>

<p>
The <i>message.code</i> element carries a <a href="datatypes.html#Coding">Coding</a> that identifies the event that the message conveys.
This table lists the message event codes defined in this specification (the system value for these is "<a href="message-events.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/message-events</a>"):
</p>

[%events%]

<p>
The request and response details: The column values are either a resource
that is included as part of the response, or an element that refers to
another resource, which means that the target of these references SHALL
also be in the message.
In this table, the request and response columns list the focus resource for the event, along with other resources that should also be carried in the message directly (if they exist).
</p>

<a name="dstu"> </a>
<blockquote>
<p>
Additional events may be defined elsewhere, though this specification does not yet define how. DSTU: Input on this is sought during the trial use period.
</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="operations"></a>
<h2>Invoking Operations via Messages</h2>

<p>
A message can be used to invoke an operation as defined for a RESTful interface using
an operation definition. To invoke an operation using a message:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The requester sends a message (a bundle with type = message, and a message header resource)</li>
 <li>The message header has an event.system of <code>urn:ietf:rfc:3986</code></li>
 <li>The event.code is the URL from the operation definition <code>OperationDefinition.url</code></li>
 <li>The <code>MessageHeader.data</code> refers to a <a href="parameters.html">Parameters</a> resource</li>
 <li>The parameters resource is populated appropriately as specified by the nominated operation definition</li>
</ul>
<p>
The recipient executes the operation as specified, and then:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The receiver sends a message (a bundle with type = message, and a message header resource)</li>
 <li>The message header has the same event as the original message</li>
 <li>The MessageHeader contains a response that refers to the original request message, and a code for the outcome, with details if the operation failed</li>
 <li>The <code>MessageHeader.data</code> refers to a <a href="parameters.html">Parameters</a> resource</li>
 <li>The parameters resource is populated appropriately as specified for the response by the nominated operation definition</li>
 <li>If the operation definition specifies a single return, then this is returned as the target of the MesssageHeader.data directly</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here's an example:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
