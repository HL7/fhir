<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
    This resource covers all type of orders for medications for a patient. This includes inpatient medication orders as well as community orders (whether filled by the prescriber or by a pharmacy). It also includes orders for over-the-counter medications (e.g. Aspirin), total parenteral nutrition and diet/ vitamin supplements. It may be used to support the order of medication-related devices. It is not intended for use in prescribing particular diets, or for ordering non-medication-related items (eyeglasses, supplies, etc.).  In addition, the MedicationRequest may be used to report orders/request from external systems that have been reported for informational purposes and are not authoritative and are not expected to be acted upon (e.g. dispensed or administered).
</p>
    <p>The MedicationRequest resource is a "request" resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html#request">Workflow Request.</a></p>


<p>
The MedicationRequest resource allows requesting only a single medication.
If a workflow requires requesting multiple items simultaneously, this is done using multiple instances of this resource.
These instances can be linked in different ways, depending on the needs of the workflow. For guidance, refer to <a href="request.html#compound">the Request pattern</a>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
    <p>The MedicationRequest resource is used to request or order medication for a subject. It may also be used to report a medication request or order from one organization or source to another.  When requesting supplies or devices when there is a patient focus or instructions regarding their use, <a href="supplyrequest.html">SupplyRequest</a> or <a href="devicerequest.html">DeviceRequest</a> should be used instead.  When reporting on the usage of a medication by a patient, the <a href="medicationUsage.html">MedicationUsage</a>t resource should be used.</p>
<p>
