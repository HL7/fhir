<h3>RxNorm MySQL Database</h3>
<p>
The RxNorm scripts are able to populate a MySQL database that contains the data from RxNorm. 
This page provides SQL statements that describe how to implement the features of the RxNorm 
terminology correctly against this database. These are provided for implementer convenience, and 
do not imply that any particular approach is required to be used in implementations. 
</p>

<h3>Correct RxNorm Display</h3>
<p>
The correct display for a CUI is the string description for it associated with the source RXNORM.
Given the RxNorm MySQL database, the correct display for a CUI can generally be determined by the 
SQL:
</p>
<pre>
 Select STR from rxnconso where RXCUI = :code and SAB = 'RXNORM' and TTY in ('SCD', 'SBD')
</pre>
<p>

Display values are not case sensitive, though case SHOULD be preserved.
</p>


<h3>Copyright/License Issues</h3>

<p>
Using RxNorm codes of type SAB=RXNORM as this specification describes <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/prescribe.html">does not require</a> a UMLS license.  
Access to the full set of RxNorm definitions, and/or additional use of other RxNorm structures 
and information requires a UMLS license. The use of RxNorm in this specification 
is pursuant to HL7's status as a licensee of the NLM UMLS. HL7's license does not convey the right to 
use RxNorm to any users of this specification; implementers must acquire a license to use RxNorm in 
their own right.

<h3>RxNorm Filter Properties</h3>

<p>
This section documents the property filters that can be used with the RxNorm 
code system in value set composition statements.
</p>
<p>
The base SQL statement for returning a list of CUIs that conform to these filters 
is:
</p>
<pre>
  Select RXCUI from rxnconso where SAB = 'RXNORM' and TTY &lt;&gt; 'SY' 
</pre>

<h3>RxNorm Properties</h3>
<p>
In addition to the <a href="terminology-service.html#standard-props">standard properties</a>, the following properties are defined for RxNorm:
</p>

<p>
(Yet to be done).
</p>
<a name="implicit"></a>

<h3>Implicit Value Sets</h3>

<p>
Implicit value sets are those whose specification can be predicted based on the grammar of the 
underlying code system, and the known structure of the URL that refers to them. At the time of this publication, RxNorm
does not define implicit value sets.
</p>

<p>
The identifier http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/vs represents a value set that contains all RxNorm CUIs.
