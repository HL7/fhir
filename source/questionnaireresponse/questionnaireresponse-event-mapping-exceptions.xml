E.g. a patient might tell two different clinicians about a historical event at different visits.  If the disclosure is from the patient rather than record transfer from clinician A to B, the recorded date would be the date each respective clinician put the data in their record.  If the data flowed from clinician A to B, the recorded date would remain the recorded date as initially set in clinician A's system."/>
