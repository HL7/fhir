<h2>EHRS Functional Model - Record Lifecycle Events Implementation Guide</h2>
<p>
This documentation should be considered "placeholder" content.  It is not complete and has not yet undergone full review by
the sponsoring work group.  While feedback is welcome, formal reconciliation will not be undertaken on ballot comments submitted
against this guide, given its extremely draft nature.
</p>
<p>
This implementation guide describes the expected capabilities for an Electronic Health Record System (EHRS) that  intends to adhere
to HL7's EHRS functional model covering the logging of record life cycle events.  This implementation guide consists of three parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="provenance-ehrs-rle.html">Profile</a> on the <a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a> resource describing the
  information that should be retained for events involving the creation or updating of electronic health records</li>
  <li>A <a href="auditevent-ehrs-rle.html">Profile</a> on the <a href="auditevent.html">AuditEvent</a> resource describing the
  information that should be retained for events involving the access or any other manipulation of electronic health records</li>
  <li>A <a href="conformance-ehrs-rle.html">Conformance Statement</a> which describes the operations an EHR system claiming conformance
  to this implementation guide must support.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For the purposes of this implementation guide, "must support" means that the system must be capable of capturing and recording
those data elements which are so-marked.</p>
