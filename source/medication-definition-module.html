<h2>Medication Definition Module</h2>

<a name="intro"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This module is concerned with resources and functionality in areas such as:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The regulation and manufacturing of drugs, medicinal products and other medically-related substances.</li>
	<li>Detailed description of these same items, typically for regulators but also for any context where this level of detail is necessary, such as pharmacopoeias, or prescribing support.</li>
	<li>Indications and contra-indications for medications.</li>
	<li>The details of the chemical substances that are ingredients for medications.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	These resources are not typically used in direct patient care or day-to-day prescribing functionality 
	(for which see the <a href="medications-module.html">Medications Module</a>) but play a supporting role.
	They have the "full" version of the product type, with all its information, including the licensed packages available, with their physical details and containers, 
	through to individual tablet level and on to ingredients and component substances.
</p>

				The MedicinalProductDefinition resource covers the detailed defining data of medicinal products, 
				to a level beyond what is typically needed for day-to-day prescribing, but that is commonly required by manufacturers and regulators, 
				and also for use in drug catalogs and pharmacopoeias.
				
				(For direct patient care when prescribing, dispensing etc. the correct resource is <a href="medication.html">Medication</a>).
			</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="packagedproductdefinition.html">PackagedProductDefinition</a></td>
		<td>
			<p>The PackagedProductDefinition resource represents one pack type of a product, that has been made available, and can also capture all aspects of the 
				physical packaging of a product. These pack types can be associated with an "owning" MedicinalProductDefinition, to represent the range of different pack 
				sizes in which that product can be obtained. These may have different legal statuses and availability, or be packaged in different ways. 
				The resource allows describing which drug items and associated co-packaged devices are within them. The actual contained items are handled by
				specific resources (e.g. <a href="manufactureditemdefinition.html">ManufacturedItemDefinition</a> and <a href="devicedefinition.html">DeviceDefinition</a>).

			<p>
				ManufacturedItemDefinition is to be used when you need to describe a physical medication item type 
				such as a tablet or capsule, or some continuous substance such as liquid or powder.  
				This is typically for regulatory or manufacturing use cases, rather than day-to-day prescribing or dispensing.
				It can carry the definition and characteristics of a medicinal (or medically-related) manufactured item, 
				usually to be contained in a <a href="packagedproductdefinition.html">packaged medicinal product</a>, 
				and not found on its own. 
				The package definition carries the quantity of each contained item, allowing re-use for different amounts</p>

				The administrable (or "pharmaceutical") product - which differs in that it is now "mixed" from its components (if necessary) 
				and is ready for use - is covered by the AdministrableProductDefinition resource. 
				The components are ManufacturedItemDefinitions.

					It is essentially a substance with the addition of the specific role it is playing in the product, which may include whether it is an active or 
					inactive substance and what the strength is (the quantity of substance compared to the whole product).

<h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Submitting a drug to a regulator for approval</li>
	<li>Creating a national level drug catalogue, including with virtual and actual medicinal products and packs</li>
	<li>Capturing information about the manufacturing of a drug</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other resources</h3>
	There are other resources that are of particular interest in the medication definition domain.
	<ul>
		<li> <a href="medication.html">Medication</a> This is the resource to use for prescribing use cases, and anywhere that an actual medication instance is needed.</li>
		<li> <a href="substance.html">Substance</a> The substance resource has a limited subset of data, and is aimed at prescribing use cases. Unlike SubstanceDefinition it can be an actual instance of a substance (e.g. an amount of an ingredient or raw material).</li>
		<li> <a href="devicedefinition.html">DeviceDefinition</a> A DeviceDefinition can be used to represent a device that is inside the package of a medicinal product, within the PackagedProductDefinition resource.</li>
		<li> <a href="organization.html">Organization</a> Many regulatory processes are centred around organizations (pharma companies, drug manufacturers, regulatory agencies). These are all represented by Organizations, and are referenced by many of the module's resources.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
<p>
	The medication definition resources don't cover any aspect of direct patient care, and in some cases the information is even in the public domain.
	However drug development often involves confidential data of a commercially sensitive nature, and as such the resources are susceptible to data breaching. 
	Necessary privacy and security provisions must be in place when transmitting, searching and fetching this information. 
	For more general considerations, see the <a href="secpriv-module.html">Security and Privacy module</a>.
