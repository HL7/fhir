		<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
		<p>
			The ClinicalUseDefinition resource is designed to represent definitional facts about the potential use of a medication, substance, 
			device, procedure, biologically derived product, or nutrition product.
		</p>
		<p>
			These may be used when submitting a product dossier to regulators, as part of an electronic medication or medical device knowledge base, or directly during
			decision support activities.
		</p>
		<p>
			The clinical issue does not refer to any actual instance of the medication, device or procedure etc. being used, or to any actual patient event.
