		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#999999; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px 4px 4px 4px;"><b><i>For an overview of this resource and others in the Medication Definition domain, also see the <a href="medication-definition-module.html">module page</a></i></b></p>
		<p>
			ClinicalUseDefinition is to record an instance of facts about a particular medication, 
			device or procedure in relation to its intended use (indication), 
			situations where it should not normally be used (contraindication), 
			known side effects (undesirable effects), clashes with other substances - medications, foods etc. 
			(interactions) and critical information about risks or hazards to caution the user or consumer (warnings). 
			The resource is used to record one such instance, and all its details.

		<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
		<p>
			The ClinicalUseDefinition resource is designed to represent definitional facts about the potential use of a medication, device or procedure.
		</p>
		<p>
			These may be used when submitting a product dossier to regulators, as part of an electronic medication or medical device knowledge base, or directly during
			decision support activities.
		</p>
		<p>
			The clinical use does not refer to any actual instance of the medication, device or procedure being used, or to any actual patient event. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The resource is used to record one instance of one of these: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Indication - A medical situation in which a medicinal product, medical device or procedure is appropriate for use</li>
			<li>Contraindication - A reason why a medicinal product, medical device or procedure is not to be used in a certain context</li>
			<li>Interaction - The interactions of the medicinal product or medical device with other medicinal products, food, substances etc.</li>
			<li>Undesirable Effect - A potential negative outcome from the use of a medicinal product, medical device or procedure. See also AdverseEvent, which is for actual events (or near misses), and AllergyIntolerance.</li>
			<li>Warning – Critical information about the environmental or health or physical risks or hazards, that serve as caution to the user or consumer.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This resource covers a range of closely related concepts that are commonly found along side each other, 
			such as all being on a Patient Information Leaflet (or its electronic representation), 
			submitted as key aspects of a product's dossier, or used together as input to a prescribing decision support system. 
			Cross-workgroup consultation resulted in an original set of separate resources being combined into this single resource, 
			with one typed definition instance per resource.
