			<p>
				The strong desire is that implementers of this resource should consider providing this resource
				in the iCalendar format as an alternative representation. Many 3rd party applications and component providers 
				have parsers and user interface controls to display this information.
				This may lower the entry point to integrate outside the health-care specific applications, and into the 
				consumer space. This would permit the easier creation of a mobile application that creates appointments
				in the devices native calendar.<br/>
				The iCalendar specification can be found at <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt</a>.
