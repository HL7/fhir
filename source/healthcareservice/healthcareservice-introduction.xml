	<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
		<p>
			The HealthcareService resource can be used with the Schedule resource to define actual availability
			of the service. This would be done by using the Schedule's Actor property.
		</p>
		<p>
			When creating an Appointment, the HealthcareService is to be assigned to one of the participants.<br/>
			It is up to the scheduling system to determine if the service is available and can be accepted.
		</p>
		<p>The HealthcareService resource is used with the following resources:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b><a href="organization.html">Organization</a></b>: The organization provides the services, the healthcareservice describes the services</li>
			<li><b><a href="servicerequest.html">ServiceRequest</a></b>: This is a subject specific request for a specific service, it may be to a specific healthcare service, and/or simply a coded service value. The granularity included in the request codes may be finer than defined in the healthcare service. </li>
			<li><b><a href="organizationaffiliation.html">OrganizationAffiliation</a></b>: Might constrain a list of healthcare services that are available between 2 organizations</li>
			<li><b><a href="location.html">Location</a></b>: Specifies the place where the service(s) are offered/available within.</li>
		</ul>
