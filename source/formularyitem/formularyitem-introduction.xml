<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
A FormularyItem is a product or service that is available through a program and includes the conditions and constraints of availability, eg. amount limits, categorization, cost limits, and other requirements for use.  This resource describes the program-specific information for a product or service.  This information is specific to the inclusion of the item in the formulary and is not inherent to the item itself.

This diagram was created for the PDEX US Drug Formulary Implementation Guide but it shows where FormularyItem would fit in a drug context.  If you abstract that to generic Insurance Plans to the left and to a set of resources that can be referenced to the right, that is the concept behind the FormularyItem resource.
