<p>
Pracitioner covers all individuals who are professionally engaged in the healthcare process, commonly (but not necessarily) on behalf 
of an organization. Their activity is part of a formal responsibility for a (part of) the healthcare process and this Resource is used 
for attribution of activities and responsibilities to these individuals.

Pactitioners include (but are not limited to):
</p>
<ul>
<li>physicians, dentists, pharmacists</li>
<li>physician assistants, nurses, scribes</li>
<li>midwives, dietitians, therapists, optometrists, paramedics</li>
<li>medical technicians, laboratory scientists, prosthetic technicians, radiographers</li>
<li>social workers, professional home carers, official volunteers</li>
<li>receptionists handling patient registration</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Resource must not be used for persons involved for non-professional reasons like individuals taking care for friends, 
relatives or neighbours. These can be registered as a Patient's Contact.
</p>
<p>
Although a Practitioner Resource represents individuals, they commonly practice their profession on behalf on an organization.
Practitioner performs different roles within the same or even different organizations. Depending on jurisdiction and custom, 
it may be necessary to maintain a specific Practitioner Resource for each such role, possibily with different relevant qualifications. 
The role is also often limited to a specific period, after which authorization for this role ends. Note that the represented organization need not necessarily be the (direct) employer of a Practitioner.
