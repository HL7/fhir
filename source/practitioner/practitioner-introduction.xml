<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
Practitioner covers all individuals who are engaged in the healthcare process and healthcare-related services as part of their formal 
responsibilities and this Resource is used for attribution of activities and responsibilities to these individuals.

Practitioners include (but are not limited to):
</p>
<ul>
<li>physicians, dentists, pharmacists</li>
<li>physician assistants, nurses, scribes</li>
<li>midwives, dietitians, therapists, optometrists, paramedics</li>
<li>medical technicians, laboratory scientists, prosthetic technicians, radiographers</li>
<li>social workers, professional homecare providers, official volunteers</li>
<li>receptionists handling patient registration</li>
<li>IT personnel merging or unmerging patient records</li>
<li>service animal (e.g., ward assigned dog capable of detecting cancer in patients)</li>
<li>a bus driver for a community organization</li>
<li>a lawyer acting for a hospital or a patient</li>
<li>a person working for a supplier of a healthcare organization</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Practitioner resource is used for anyone involved in the provision of care or services to a
  Patient associated with an organization. The RelatedPerson resource is used for anyone involved
  in the care for a patient, typically having a personal *relationship *or non-healthcare-specific
  professional relationship to the patient.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
The Resource SHALL NOT be used for persons involved without a formal responsibility like individuals taking care for friends, 
relatives or neighbors. These can be registered as a Patient's Contact.  If performing some action or being referenced by another
resource, use the <a href="relatedperson.html">RelatedPerson</a> resource.
</p>
<p>
	The primary distinction between a Practitioner and a RelatedPerson is based on whether:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	The person/animal operates on behalf of the care delivery organization over multiple patients (Practitioner) or,
</li>
<li>
	Where the person/animal is not associated with the organization, and instead is
	allocated tasks specifically for the RelatedPerson's Patient (RelatedPerson).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
	A standard extension <a href="[%extensions-location%]StructureDefinition-practitioner-animalSpecies.html">animalSpecies</a> can be used to indicate the species of a service animal.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="practitionerrole.html">PractitionerRole</a> resource provides the details of roles that the practitioner 
  is approved to perform for which organizations (and at which locations, and optionally what services too).
</p>
<p>
  Practitioners are also often grouped into <a href="careteam.html">CareTeams</a> independently of roles, where the CareTeam
  defines what specific role that they are fulfilling within the team, and might or might not have actual practitioner role resources
  created for the practitioner (and in the care team context, the organization the practitioner is representing)
</p>
<p>
  When an autonomous system or machine is an actor or participant, the <a href="device.html">Device</a> resource should be used to represent that system.
  This would include artificial intelligence or machine learning (AI/ML) systems, as well as other automated systems.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
Practitioner performs different roles within the same or even different organizations. Depending on jurisdiction and custom, 
it may be necessary to maintain a specific Practitioner Resource for each such role or have a single Practitioner with multiple roles.
The role can be limited to a specific period, after which authorization for this role ends. Note that the represented organization
need not necessarily be the (direct) employer of a Practitioner.
