    The <code>Practitioner.identifier</code> doesn't convey anything about the status of the license (other than period), if this or any additional details are available
    then the <code>qualification.identifier</code> should be used.<br/>
    E.g. a specific license includes its type, status, issuer and a local category extension for which specialties were included in the license.
