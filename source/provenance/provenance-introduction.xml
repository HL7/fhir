<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The provenance resource tracks information about activity that created a version of a resource, including the entities, and agents involved in producing a resource.
This information can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness, or to provide pointers for where to go to further investigate the origins of the resource and the information in it. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="provenance.html">Provenance resources</a> are a record-keeping assertion that gathers information about the context in which the information in a resource was obtained. 
Provenance resources are prepared by the application that initiates the create/update etc. of the resource.
A <a href="securityevent.html">Security Event</a> resource contains overlapping information, but is created as events occur, to track and audit the events. 
Security Event resources are often (though not exclusively) created by the application responding to the read/query/create/update etc. event.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
The provenance resource is based on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-prov-overview-20130430/">W3C Provenance specification</a>, 
and mappings are provided. The Provenance resource is tailored to fit the FHIR use-cases for provenance more directly. 
The W3C Provenance Specification has the following fundamental model:

The <i>Provenance</i> resource actually corresponds to a single activity that identifies a set of resources (<i>target</i>) generated by the activity.
The activity also references other entities (<i>entity</i>) that were used and the agents (<i>agent</i>) that were associated with the activity.
