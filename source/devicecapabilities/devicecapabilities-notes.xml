<h3>Usage Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
In very simple devices, the device capabilities will be fixed for every device. In particular, there will be no identity reference. 
With devices such as these, the system receiving the data must be aware of the device identity and the subject so that data can be interpreted correctly. 
More sophisticated machines may identify themselves as part of their capabilities declaration.
</li>
<li>
The device log resource uses the key values on the metric and facet elements to link a piece of data to the correct information that defines how to 
interpret it. This process is discussed in detail on the <a href="devicelog.htm">Device Log</a> resource.
