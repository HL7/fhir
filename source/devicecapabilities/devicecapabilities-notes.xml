<h3>Usage Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
In very simple devices, the device capabilities will be fixed for every device. In particular, there will be no identity reference. 
With devices such as these, the system receiving the data must be aware of the device identity and the subject so that data can be interpreted correctly. 
More sophisticated machines may identify themselves as part of their capabilities declaration.
</li>
<li>
The device log resource specifies the key values on the metric and facet elements which are used to link a 
piece of data in the device log to the metric and facet definitions in the this resource. See the <a href="devicelog.html">Device Log</a> resource for more information.
