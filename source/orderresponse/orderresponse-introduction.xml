<p>
The response to an order indicates the outcome of processing the order itself - whether it 
was accepted or rejected, or is still in process. The order response resource does not itself convey 
or represent information that arises as a result of performing the actual order, but it may have 
references to other resources that do have this information, in order to link between the original
order and its outcome.
</p>
<p>
There may be multiple responses for a given order. For some requests, a responding system
may issue a sequence of responses, where each response replaces previous responses as the original
order is processed/performed. In these cases, each response should have the same logical identity, and 
the multiple responses are different versions of the same overall response. 
</p>
<p>
If there are multiple systems responding to the request, or if there request may have multiple
different responses, then the different logical responses should have different logical ids.
