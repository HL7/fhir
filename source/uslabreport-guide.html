         <h2>Purpose</h2>
         <p>
            The FHIR USLab Report Implementation focuses on identifying the requirements, specifications
            and standards, and on providing the implementation guidance for reporting of laboratory
            test results to ambulatory care providers in the US Realm using <a href="http.html">the FHIR in the RESTful framework</a>.  Its scope
            includes requirements to enable the incorporation of clinical laboratory test
            results into an Electronic Health Record System (EHR-S) as standardized structured data using the
            defined inter-organizational laboratory transaction. The Use Case requirements are directed at
            laboratory test results reporting between a Laboratory Information System (LIS) and an ambulatory
            EHR-S in different organizational entities, e.g., different corporate structure, ownership or
            governance. Future versions of this implementation may harmonize with existing guides to extend
            interoperability of laboratory results across care settings, e.g., acute care and public health.

         <p>
            This guide is designed for use by analysts and developers who require guidance on FHIR resources, elements and specific extensions
            relative to the Laboratory Orders Interface (LOI) initiative and the HL7 V3 Lab Normative Standard. Users of this guide must be familiar with the details of the FHIR Specification and resource
            processing. This guide is not intended to be a tutorial on that subject.

            the base HL7 V2.5.1 Standard to determine how these optional message elements will be used.
            Conformance information is provided when a conditional predicate resolves to an "R" or "RE" on
            either the "a" or "b" part of the expression, regardless of the opposite value, e.g., C(R/O).

         <!--  EH not needed : This guide provides conditional predicates for some fields; note that the condition may be dependent

            should be "if the optional element is used, then these additional constraints are now required." That
            is, if the optional element is present, then these additional constraints are now active. This guidance
            is included as it is logically true but these conditional elements are not tested. -->
         <!--  EH not needed : This guide uses "X" as a conformance usage indicator very sparingly. Where the underlying standard

            for the use case have been given the "X" usage. All other message elements have either been further
            constrained to R/RE/C(a/b) or have been left as "O" to enable trading partners to explore additional
            capabilities. Note that without a clearly agreed to complementary profile between trading partners,
            an EHR that is compliant with this implementation guide does not have to send any elements marked
            as an "O", nor does a receiver of a lab order that is compliant with this implementation guide have to
            process any elements marked as an "O". Neither trading partner can mandate the other to accept any
            such complementary profiles to enable basic laboratory orders interfacing "out-of-the-box".  -->

         <h3>Profile And Component Architecture </h3>
         <!-- also in uslaborder.html-->
         <p>This guide uses FHIR profiles on the following resource to define a minimum set of requirements to enable the
            successful exchange of laboratory orders:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>DiagnosticOrder</li>
            <li>DiagnosticReport</li>
            <li>Organization</li>
            <li>Media</li>
            <li>Organization</li>
            <li>Patient</li>
            <li>Practitioner</li>
            <li>Specimen</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            The main objective is to ensure that EHR systems and
            Laboratory systems can exchange laboratory orders with minimum if any modifications from one
            combination to another combination of software, while maintaining flexibility to enable software
            developers to provide more capabilities using the same core Resource definitions.
         </p>
         <!--EH not needed: 2.7.2  USE OF ISO OBJECT IDENTIFIER (OID)
            OIDs, or Object Identifiers, provide a strong identifier that uniquely identifies the object in question and
            is global in scope. Examples of information that OIDs can identify are items about patients, orders,
            providers and organizations. This means the identifier includes enough information to remain unique
            when taken out of the context within which the identifier was created. The ISO OID specification
            (ISO/IEC 8824:1990(E)) is the globally accepted technology for this purpose and is recommended as the
            means to satisfy the requirement for a universally unique identifier.
            This guide defines a Globally Unique Component (LOI_GU_Component) (see Section 2.9.1.2) that
            prescribes the use of an ISO Object Identifier (OID) for a specific set of fields.
            The GU/NG profile definition discusses use of OIDs for identifiers' assigning authority only. Other
            identifiers could use OIDs as well for the assigning authority. Note that OIDs are not intended to be used
            to identify a coding system as referenced in CWE-03/CWE-06 and further enumerated in . -->
         <a name="vocabstandards"></a>
         <h3>Use Of Vocabulary Standards</h3>
         <p>This guide calls for specific vocabulary standards for the exchange of laboratory information such as
            LOINC and SNOMED. Standard vocabularies, particularly coded laboratory tests and their results,
            enable automated decision support for patient healthcare, as well as for public health surveillance of
            populations. Value Sets resource are provided as part of this implementation.
         </p>
         <a name="snapshot"></a>
         <h3>Snapshot Mode </h3>
         FHIR only functions using snapshot mode - updates are communicated by sending a complete copy of the instance with the new data filled in.  If a correction and/or status update to Obsveration Resource is necessary, the DiagnosticReport with all references to all Obsveration Resource, even if previously
         sent, shall be resent with the correction and/or current status and/or current values. For example,
         when a Complete Blood Count with manual differential is ordered, the blood count will be released
         and then at a later time the manual differential will be performed and released. When the blood count
         is released the DiagnosticReport will reference only the Observation Resources for the count as final results. When the differential is completed,
         the DiagnosticReport will reference all previous Observation Resources as well as the new Observation resources -  in this case the blood
         count and the differential results.

         <h3>Scope Of Implementation</h3>
         <!--EH not needed: The base standard indicates that receiving applications "…shall process (save/print/archive/etc.)…". For
            order-specific segments, e.g., ORC, OBR, SPM, this typically means saving that data. For other
            segments, e.g., MSH, the receiving application may not always have to save the data as the segment is
            focused on ensuring the order-specific data arrives in the appropriate place and therefore may have
            shorter-term value. -->
         <p>Due to receiving system variations and need, this guide does not specifically indicate for each field
            whether to store it or not. This is left to the individual system's scope and purpose.

         <h3>User Story</h3>
         <p>
            A Provider (orderer) may enter a laboratory order into an ambulatory EHR-S. A laboratory
            requisition is generated (paper or electronic) and is communicated to the laboratory. The information
            in the laboratory requisition is entered manually or captured electronically into the LIS. After the
            specimen(s) has been collected and, if necessary, shipped or delivered to the laboratory, the
            laboratory processes the specimen(s). If the specimen is satisfactory for testing the laboratory will
            perform the test. Prior to successful completion of a test, communication may also be necessary to
            indicate cancellation, failure to perform the test and the related reasons; for example if the specimen
            is either not appropriate for the ordered test, or otherwise unsatisfactory the rejection of the specimen
            will be communicated using USlabReport profile. Order cancellation notifications should be
            communicated using the USLabOrder profile. The laboratory performs or attempts to perform the test(s). If testing is
            successful, results are obtained and entered/released in the LIS. An authorized person at the
            laboratory reviews and approves the laboratory test results, or the certifying laboratory reviewer of
            record in the case of an auto-verification process, to be sent to the provider and any non-ordering providers requested in the laboratory order.
            The results are either <a href="pushpull.html">pushed or pulled</a> into  the provider's EHR-S (results receiver).
            The EHR-S incorporates the results into the patient's electronic record. The provider logs into his/her
            EHR-S and views the laboratory results in order to inform patient care decisions.

         <h2>Code Systems And Value Sets</h2>
         <p>Successful message implementation requires that transmitted messages (message instances) contain
            valid values for coded fields. For further discussion on <a href="terminologies.html">Using codes in FHIR </a> refer to the FHIR specification.
         </p>
         <h3>LOINC</h3>
         <p>The use of the <a href="http://loinc.org/ ">Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) </a> code system is required
            where a LOINC code is available for the Observation.name,  i.e. the being resulted.   Appropriate status is defined in the LOINC
            Manual Section 11.2 Classification of LOINC Term Status. If a local coding system is in use, a local code should also be sent in addition to the LOINC to help with identification of coding issues. When no valid LOINC exists the local code may be the only code sent.
         </p>
         <p>While data storage requirements in the EHR will not be addressed in this guide, it is recommended
            that LOINC codes be stored in or accessible by the EHR for the following reasons:
        </p>

         <ol>
            <li>If the result is related to a reportable condition and the laboratory provides a LOINC code, </li>
            <li>Meaningful Use Stage requires the EHR to send the LOINC code to public health.  If the LOINC code is the only code sent to the lab in OBX-3, then the EHR must store and retain
               that code to satisfy CLIA reporting requirements.
            </li>
            <li>LOINC codes may be used for secondary data exchange purposes and other partner exchange
               agreements.
            </li>
         </ol>
         <h3>SNOMED CT</h3>
         <p>The use of the <a href="http://snomed.info/sct">SNOMED-CT</a> code system is required
            where a SNOMED-CT concept code is available for Observation.valueCodeableConcept,  i.e. the actiual coded result.   If a local coding system is in use, a local code should also be sent in addition to the SNOMED-CT concept code to help with identification of coding issues. When no valid SNOMED-CT exists the local code may be the only code sent.  to satisfy CLIA reporting requirements, It also recommended that the Observation.valueCodeableConcept.text element is used if laboratory's original text which is used for printing and/or display is different from the code display value.
         </p>
         <p>SNOMED CT is required for specimen source term elements, Specimen.type and Specimen.Collection.sourceSite where a SNOMED-CT concept code is available.</p>
         <h3>UCUM</h3>
         <p>The use of the <a href="http://unitsofmeasure.org">UCUM (Unified Code for Units of Measure)</a> code system is required for reporting units of
            measure in Observation.quantity.

         <a name="reflex"></a>
         <h3>Confirmatory and Reflex Testing ( Including Culture/Susceptibility Testing)</h3>
         <p><b>Definition: </b>  Additional laboratory testing included in the original test request by reference to specific
            follow-up testing, e.g. "Urinalysis w/Culture Reflex" as opposed to "Urinalysis" ordered as a
            standalone test. The decision to perform the reflex or confirmatory test is based upon the results of
            the initial test and application of a predetermined local or national practice guideline, approved
            protocol or legal requirement.
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li><b>Example: </b> A Urinalysis with elevated WBCs signals the potential for bacterial infection and a
               confirmatory Urine Culture is ordered on the same specimen as a reflex test. Depending on the
               laboratory standard operating procedure, LIS and nature of the reflexed or confirmatory test
               one or more of the following may be generated: a new accession number, new test codes and
               additional charges.
            </li>
            <li><b>CLIA Compliance: </b> The initial test request received in the laboratory is adequate to
               demonstrate an order for both the initial and the additional testing for CLIA compliance and
               CMS auditing purposes.
               </li>
               <li>
               <a name="reflexprocess"></a>
               <b> LIS Process: </b>The LIS shall report the reflexed test as one of the following:
               <ol>
                  <li>Additional results within the same DiagnosticReport.referencing the same DiagnosticOrder from the original order request in the DiagnosticReport.requestDetail element</li>
                  <li>One or more additional DiagnosticReports referencing the same DiagnosticOrder from the original order request in the DiagnosticReport.requestDetail element</li>
                  <li>One or more additional DiagnosticReports referencing a new DiagnosticOrder from add-on order request and the DiagnosticOrder from the original order request in the DiagnosticReport.requestDetail element</li>
               </ol>

            <a name="addon"></a>
         <h3>Add-On Testing</h3>
         <p><b>Definition: </b> Additional laboratory testing is requested by an authorized provider (as defined by CLIA
            and state law) on an existing specimen after the original test request has been submitted to the laboratory. The decision to request additional testing is individual provider driven and based on any
            number of factors not limited to a test result.
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li><b>Example: </b>A physician orders a Complete Blood Count and Basic Metabolic Panel on an
               outpatient who presented in the office with symptoms of fatigue and a low-grade fever
               following a camping trip to Wisconsin. After consultation with an infectious disease
               physician later in the day, he calls the laboratory and requests the addition of a Lyme's
               Disease Antibody test to the specimens already in the laboratory.
            </li>
            <li><b>CLIA Compliance: </b>CLIA requires the laboratory to obtain a written or electronic test
               request for the add-on testing from the authorized provider for its records. If the test request
               is verbal the laboratory must document its efforts to receive a written or electronic test
               request within 30 days. [&sect;42CFR493.1241(b)]
            </li>

         <h3>Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments Considerations </h3>
         <p>In the United States, clinical laboratory testing of human specimens is regulated by the Clinical
            Laboratory Improvements Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). Several sections of the regulations
            implementing CLIA impact how electronic laboratory data is formatted for the US Realm and these are
            outlined in this section. Impacted areas include mandatory test request requirements.
            <a href="http://wwwn.cdc.gov/clia/regs/toc.aspx">CLIA Regulation Specifics</a>.
         </p>
         <h3>Mandatory Ordering Requirements</h3>
         <p><a href="http://wwwn.cdc.gov/clia/regs/subpart_k.aspx493.1241">Section 493.1241 of the CLIA Regulations</a> requires the laboratory to have a written or electronic request
            for patient testing from an authorized person, and defines items that must appear as part of a clinical
            laboratory test request . The laboratory may
            accept oral requests for laboratory tests if it solicits a written or electronic authorization within 30 days
            of the oral request and maintains the authorization or documentation of its efforts to obtain the
            authorization.

         <p>The following <a href="http://www.clsi.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Resources/HarmonizedTerminologyDatabase/Harmonized_Terminolo.htm">defnitions</a> were derived from the CLSI website:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <b>QUANTITATIVE </b>
               <ul>
                  <li>A characterization applied to laboratory tests that give results expressing a numerical amount
                     or level (concentration) of an analyte in a specimen; <br/>
                     NOTE 1: It is usually compared to an accredited recognized standard;  <br/>
                     NOTE 2: This is in contrast to qualitative tests.
                  </li>
                  <li>When used to describe a test, means a test that produces a result that is numerical. For
                     example, a point-of-care blood glucose test might generate a result of 120 mg/dL (1.20 g/L).
                     In contrast, a qualitative test generates a non-numerical result such as 'positive' or 'detected.'
                     A subset of quantitative tests called semiquantitative provides results either over a range of
                     values, such as a urine dipstick that results in glucose ranges of 0-40, 40-100, and >100
                     mg/dL (0-0.4, 0.4-1, and >1 g/L), or as a series of relative values, such as the same multiple
                     test urine dipstick that results in hemoglobin as 0, +, ++, +++, and ++++.
                  </li>

            </li>
            <li>
               <b>QUALITATIVE </b>
               <ul>
                  <li>When used to describe a test, means a test that produces a result that is descriptive rather than
                     numerical. For example, a urine pregnancy test might generate a result of 'positive' or 'negative'
                     for urinary hCG. In contrast, a quantitative test generates a numerical result. The quality control
                     and reporting procedures differ significantly for quantitative and qualitative tests.
                  </li>
                  <li>Characterization applied to laboratory tests that detect and/or identify a particular analyte,
                     constituent, or condition;  <br/>
                     NOTE 1: This term is applied to tests that detect whether a particular analyte, constituent, or
                     condition is present or absent, and is sometimes assigned a positive degree (ie, 1+, 2+);  <br/>
                     NOTE 2: It may also be called semiquantitative tests;  <br/>
                     NOTE 3: Specific identification may be performed.

               <ul>
                  <li>A test that has a dose-response gradient that may be included in the reported result, but for which
                     no authorative calibration scale exists to determine inaccuracy and imprecision; tests that yield
                     results in an approximate range of values (e.g., trace, moderate);  <br/>
                     NOTE: This definition includes tests with subjective readout of quantification such as IF-ANA
                     titers, and it includes tests with an instrumental readout of quantification such as ELISA-ANA

               "It is important to note that the DSTU does not attempt to establish another definition for EHR Systems,
               but chooses to utilize existing definitions that include the concept of EHR Systems as a system (at least
               one) or a system-of- systems that cooperatively meet the needs of the end user."
            </li>
            <li><b>Future Order:  </b>A future order is an order with a start date/time where that start date/time indicates the earliest time the
               specimen can be collected.
            </li>
            <li><b>Laboratory:  </b>A facility or organization that performs laboratory testing on specimens for the purpose of providing
               information for the diagnosis, prevention, treatment of disease or impairment, or assessment of health for
               humans.
               Laboratory Information
               System (LIS)
               An information system that receives, processes, and stores information related to laboratory processes.
               LIS may interface with HIS and EHR applications.
               This definition is very minimal and omits many features and capabilities that are typically associated with
               laboratory information systems. This minimal characterization is intentional, as to include the broadest
               possible set of LIS systems in the use case. The minimal nature of the definition by no means excludes
               LIS with significantly greater capabilities.

            <!-- EH - do we need this here? <li><b>Laboratory Message:  </b>An electronic communication between a Laboratory Order System and a Laboratory Information System
               related to laboratory testing. Laboratory messages may be used to request that one or more tests be
               performed, to change previous requests for testing, to report the cancellation of requested tests, or to
               report the results of requested tests.
               </li> -->
            <li><b>Laboratory Order:  </b>a DiagnosticOrder Resource item requesting  one or more measurements (Observation Resources). Synonymous with a Requisition when referring to a single DiagnosticOrder Resource item. </li>
            <li><b>Laboratory Order System:  </b>Software, either stand-alone or as part of an EHR system, used by a Provider (Order Placer) to 			manage a  laboratory order, including generating the laboratory requisition and sending it to a laboratory.
               Typically a laboratory order system is an integral part of an order management system that enables users
               to manage orders for many different types of services, procedures, supplies, etc. Since this guide only
               focuses on data exchange relative to laboratory orders it is purposely using a very limited definition.
            </li>
            <li><b>Laboratory Requisition:  </b>A set of information that constitutes an official request for one or more laboratory tests to be performed on
               an individual patient. A laboratory requisition is specified in a clinical setting and communicated to a
               laboratory as a discrete paper or electronic artifact. Laboratory requisitions always include at least one
               test order. In terms of a FHIR order transaction it represents one or more DiagnosticOrders Resource item(s).
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Newborn:  </b>The precise cutoff when a patient is considered a newborn or an infant is subject to interpretation and this
               guide does not intend to provide a definitive answer to that. For further background the reader is directed
               to the following resources:

               </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Orderable Test:  </b>A request to perform an individual test or panel. It always refers to a single  DiagnosticOrder Resource item. and 		may have one or more associated analytes (bservations).
            </li>
            <li><b>Panel:  </b>While there are differences in the meanings of the terms "panel" among various laboratories, for the
               purposes of this guide, it is defined as a grouping of procedures that measure multiple analytes from a
               single specimen (or multiple specimens in some cases) and can be requested through one laboratory
               order. This is also referred to as a battery. For example, a CBC or a urinalysis may be referred to as a
               panel.
            </li>
            <li><b>Order Set:  </b>A set of laboratory orders that involve multiple tests and panels and that may require multiple specimens,
               but can be requested as a single unit for convenience. For example, a "diabetic order set profile" might
               include a CBC, a glycosylated hemoglobin test, and a urinalysis. The term "panel" is frequently used
               interchangeably with "order set", thus an order set profile that contains a variety of laboratory test orders
               that may be on its own or be combined with other test orders (e.g., radiology image, consult, etc.) can be
               considered an order set. Order sets shall not be communicated to the laboratory.
               Request for Cancellation
               (RFC)
               Request by the Provider (Order Placer) not to perform the order.
            </li>
            <li><b>Test:  </b>A medical procedure or named set of related procedures that involves analyzing one analyte using a
               single sample of blood, urine, or other specimen from a patient for the purpose of diagnosing a disease or
               medical condition, planning or evaluating treatment, or monitoring the course of a disease.
