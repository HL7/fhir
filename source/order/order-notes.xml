<h2>Processing Order Details</h2>

<p>
Each request includes one or more <i>detail</i> elements that specify what is being ordered.
The following kind of orders can be made:
</p>
<table class="grid">
  <tr>
    <th>Description</th>
	<th>Order Resource</th>
	<th>Response Resources</th>
	<th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Request for Diagnostic Investigation</td>
	<td><a href="diagnosticorder.html">DiagnosticOrder</a></td>
	<td>0..* <a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReport</a></td>
	<td>Local work flow arrangements will determine whether the laboratory handles a request by waiting for a specimen, or for the patient, or by visiting the patient directly to obtain the specimen (i.e. phlebotomy ward round)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Order to supply a prescription</td>
	<td><a href="medicationprescription.html">MedicationPrescription</a></td>
	<td>0..* <a href="medicationadministration.html">MedicationAdministration</a> or <a href="medicationdispense.html">MedicationDispense</a></td>
	<td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Transfer of care from one practitioner to another</td>
	<td>Referral (Resource not yet developed)</td>
	<td>n/a</td>
	<td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Note that a resource may only be used for the order details if the resource 
type explicitly defines how it is known to be something requested, as opposed 
to (for instance) something that has happened. For some resources, such 
as a prescription, this is defined to be always true, while other resources 
may have some kind of status element for this purpose. If the resource type does 
not explicitly define this, then it cannot be the target of an order.
