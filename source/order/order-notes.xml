<h2>Processing Order Details</h2>

<p>
Each request includes one or more <i>detail</i> elements that specify what is being ordered.
The following kind of orders can be made:
</p>
<table class="grid">
  <tr>
    <th>Description</th>
	<th>Order Resource</th>
	<th>Response Resources</th>
	<th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Request for Diagnostic Investigation</td>
	<td><a href="diagnosticorder.htm">DiagnosticOrder</a></td>
	<td>0..* <a href="diagnosticreport.htm">DiagnosticReport</a></td>
	<td>Local work flow arrangements will determine whether the laboratory handles a request by waiting for a specimen, or for the patient, or by visiting the patient directly to obtain the specimen (i.e. phlebotomy ward round)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Order to supply a prescription</td>
	<td><a href="medicationprescription.htm">MedicationPrescription</a></td>
	<td>0..* <a href="medicationadministration.htm">MedicationAdministration</a> or <a href="medicationdispense.htm">MedicationDispense</a></td>
	<td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Transfer of care from one practitioner to another</td>
	<td>Referral (Resource not yet developed)</td>
	<td>n/a</td>
	<td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Note that a resource may only be used for the order details if the resource 
type explicitly defines how it is known to be something requested, as opposed 
to (for instance) something that has happened. For some resources, such 
as a prescription, this is defined to be always true, while other resources 
may have some kind of status element for this purpose. If the resource type does 
not explicitly define this, then it cannot be the target of an order.
</p>

<h2>Auction Protocol</h2>

<p>
The order and response resources can be used in an auction context, where the 
order will actually be offered to multiple service providers and then fulfilled
by a single provider based on some criteria determined from their responses. The 
auction protocol may be implemented explicitly by the end user and provider of 
the order/response, or, in some cases, it may be implemented (partially) 
transparently by a broker system that sits between them.
</p>
<p>
In the auction protocol, the order is created without a specified target 
provider that is intended to fulfill the order. This order is passed to 
multiple target systems that provide a response based on the service and 
cost they are prepared to provide. The source or broker selects a preferred
provider based on the information provided, updates the target provider on 
the order and then updates the order in the repository or resends it to 
the original target systems, which know whether or not they are the winner 
of the auction by the target system value.
