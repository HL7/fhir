<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
This is <b>NOT</b> a resource.  It is not part of the FHIR schema and cannot appear directly in FHIR instances.  It is a logical model that defines a pattern adhered to by
other resources.  This pattern is defined to provide a standard "view" that might be useful for implementers in processing and manipulating all resources that adhere 
to this pattern. Typically, this appears in object frameworks as an interface that the various resources that adhere to the pattern implement.

<p>
A "<a href="participant.html">participant</a>" takes part in a process, and may be the subject of process, or responsible for the event occurring, or may 
be responsible for recording or reporting information about the event. Examples include patients, practitioners, organizations, 
groups of patients or practitioners. 
</p>
<p>
A contactable participant is a participant that has a phone number and an address at which it may be contacted.

<div>
<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
This pattern applies to some participants. Some of the participants share other properties, and 
richer patterns are described for these:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="participantliving.html"><b>ParticipantLiving</b></a>: a living participant, usually a human</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
Though this pattern is intended instantiated by many resources, as listed below), there is some variation in the value domains of the underlying 
resources, and any use of the pattern will need to account for this. <a href="conceptmap.html">ConceptMaps</a> describing the relationship in a 
computable manner are provided as part of the definition.
