  <h3>Representing the Sequence</h3>
  <p>
  This resource supports three patterns for representing a sequence of interest:
  <ul>
    <li>By providing a “literal” string of IUPAC codes representing nucleotides or amino acids.</li>
    <li>By linking to a “formatted” file or link containing the sequence information (e.g. FASTA file or GA4GH sequence repository).</li>
    <li>By providing a list of “edits” from a reference sequence.</li>
  </ul>
  Implementers SHALL use only one of the above patterns to represent the sequence of interest.
  </p>
  <h4>Sequence as a literal string</h4>
  <p>
    <code>MolecularSequence.literal</code>: This string element can be used to hold the sequence as a string of characters.
  </p>
  <h4>Sequence as a file or URL</h4>
  <p>
    <code>MolecularSequence.formatted</code>: This Attachment is used to refer to the sequence as embedded file content or via a URL reference.
  </p>
  <p>
    This method can be used to refer to sequence data from an an external source. If the sequence is referring to a GA4GH repository, the <code>MolecularSequence.formatted.url</code> should refer to a GA4GH compliant endpoint that conforms to GA4GH data models.
  </p>
  <h4>Sequence as a series of edits from a known sequence</h4>
  <p>
    <code>MolecularSequence.relative</code>: This complex element is used for encoding sequence. When the information of reference sequence and edits are provided, the observed sequence will be derived. Here is a picture below:

  <h5>Representing the Reference Sequence</h5>
  <p>
    <code>MolecularSequence.relative.reference</code>: There are four optional ways to represent a reference sequence in MolecularSequence
    resource:
    <ol>
      <li><code>MolecularSequence.relative.reference.referenceSeqId</code>: Reference sequence id in public database;</li>
      <li><code>MolecularSequence.relative.reference.referenceSeqString</code>: Reference sequence string; </li>
      <li><code>MolecularSequence.relative.reference.referenceSeqPointer</code>: Reference to observed sequence stored in another sequence entity; </li>
      <li><code>MolecularSequence.relative.reference.genomeBuild</code>, <code>MolecularSequence.relative.reference.chromosome</code>: The combination of genome build and chromosome. </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>MolecularSequence.relative.reference.window</code> defines a range from the reference sequence that is used to define building block of a sequence.
  </p>
  <h5>Coordinate System</h5>
  <p>
    When saving the sequence information, the nucleic acid will be numbered with order. Some representations use a 0-based system (e.g. GA4GH API, BAM files) while some use a 1-based system (e.g. VCF file format). The element coordinateSystem contains this information.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>MolecularSequence.relative.coordinateSystem</code> binds to a LOINC answer list, please review those answers <a href="https://loinc.org/LL5323-2/">here</a> as well as the detailed description found <a href="https://loinc.org/92822-6/">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p> 
    Here are two examples:
    <ul>
      <li>0-based example: <a href="coord-0base-example.html">here</a></li>
      <li>1-based example: <a href="coord-1base-example.html">here</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h5>Choice of Strand</h5>
  <p>
    There are lots of definition concerning with the directionality of DNA or RNA. Here we are using <code>MolecularSequence.relative.reference.orientation</code> and <code>MolecularSequence.relative.reference.strand</code>. <b>Orientation</b> represents the sense of the sequence, which has different meanings depending on the <code>MolecularSequence.type</code>. <b>Strand</b> represents the sequence writing order. Watson strand refers to 5' to 3' top strand (5' -&gt; 3'), whereas Crick strand refers to 5' to 3' bottom strand (3' &lt;- 5').
  </p>
  <p>
    Only two possible values can be made by strand, +1 for plus strand while -1 for minus strand. Since the directionality of the sequence string might be represented in different word in different omics scenario, below are simple example of how to map other expressions into its correlated value:
  </p>
  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
      <th>Map to +1</th>
      <th>Map to -1</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5′-to-3′ direction</td>
      <td>3′-to-5′ direction</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Watson</td>
      <td>Crick</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sense</td>
      <td>Antisense</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Positive</td>
      <td>Negative</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<h3>Character usage for sequence as strings</h3>
<p>
  There are attributes where the sequence is represented as a string of characters.
    <ul>
      <li><code>relative.reference.referenceSeqString</code></li>
      <li><code>relative.edit.observedAllele</code></li>
      <li><code>relative.edit.referenceAllele</code></li>
      <li><code>literal</code></li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
  The characters used in these string representations of a sequence should be constrained to the IUPAC codes found here <a href="https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/iupac.html">https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/iupac.html</a>.
