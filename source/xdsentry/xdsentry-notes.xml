<h3>Entries and Folders</h3>

<p>
In XDS, each patient has a series of documents. The documents are each entered in the registry as an 
XdsEntry that describes the document and its metadata (format/type/etc. + patient/author/etc.) and 
references the actual source of the document by a URL at which it may be retrieved.
</p>
<p>
In addition, documents may be placed into folders that serve to support additional workflow 
associated with documents. A document may be placed into multiple folders or none at all. 
Each entry identifies the folders with which it is associated by listing the folder 
references in the XdsEntry resource. There is a separate resource
<a href="xdsfolder.html">XdsFolder</a>, which details the folders that have been created for 
a specific patient. 
</p>
<p>
Note that there is no system wide list of folders, nor do folders need to be predefined before 
they are used, though servers may choose to impose additional rules concerning which folders
may be used.
</p>
<p>
A client may retrieve the list of folders associated with a patient by searching the folders 
with a patientId parameter, and a list of documents in a folder by searching the documents
with a folderId parameter.
</p>
<p>
To place an entry in a folder, a client should first ensure that a folder exists with the
appropriate codes, and/or determine its identity, and then create/update the XdsEntry 
resource so that the folder reference is listed in the XdsEntry.folder list.
