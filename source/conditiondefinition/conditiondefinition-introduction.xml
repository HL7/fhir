<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
A condition definition defines a set of system properties for a particular condition. 
</p>
<p>
It is important to understand the condition definition resource is not intended to be 
used to define the underlying biological or ontological basis for the condition; instead 
the focus is on how the the condition is identified, managed, and treated.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<ul>
<li>Conditions may have a matching condition definition, but need not do so</li>
<li>Condition definitions may identify observations and signs (including, but not limited to) lab tests that are indicative of the condition</li>
<li>Condition definitions often identify ongoing observations to prioritize when viewing the chart of patients with the conditions</li>
<li>Condition definitions may identify applicable care plans</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
One frequent criticism of information systems in healthcare is that they do not adapt well to changing context, 
particularly the context of what is specifically wrong. A typical institution will have 20-30,000 different kinds
of observational data, but only a small portion of these are relevant to any particular condition. Information 
systems supporting clinical care provision are increasingly investigating the use of AI, but ConditionDefinition
provides a simple way to help the system be more adaptive.
