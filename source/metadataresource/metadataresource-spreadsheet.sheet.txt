  Element = MetadataResource.purpose
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = markdown

  Definition = Explains why this {{title}} is needed and why it has been designed as it has
  Comments = This element does not describe the usage of the {{title}} (See, e.g, the comments element, or relatedArtifacts), rather it\'s for traceability of \'\'why\'\' the resource is either needed or \'\'why\'\' it is defined as it is.  This may be used to point to source materials or specifications that drove the structure of this {{title}}
  Object Impl = no-gen-base
