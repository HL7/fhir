 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource
  Card. = 1..1
  UML = 230;160
  Type = DomainResource
  Short Name = Common Ancestor declaration for definitional resources
  Definition = Common Ancestor declaration for conformance and knowledge artifact resources
  w5 = conformance.behavior

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.url
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = y
  Type = uri
  Short Name = Logical URI to reference this {{title}} (globally unique)
  Definition = An absolute URI that is used to identify this {{title}} when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this {{title}} is (or will be) published. The URL SHOULD include the major version of the {{title}}. For more information see [Technical and Business Versions](resource.html#versions).
  Requirements = Allows the {{title}} to be referenced by a single globally unique identifier
  Comments = Can be a urn:uuid: or a urn:oid:, but real http: addresses are preferred
  w5 = id

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.identifier
  Card. = 0..*
  Summary = y
  Type = Identifier
  Short Name = Additional identifier for the {{title}}
  Definition = A formal identifier that is used to identify this {{title}} when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance.
  Requirements = Allows externally provided and/or usable business identifiers to be easily associated with the module
  Comments = Typically, this is used for identifiers that can go in an HL7 V3 II (instance identifier) data type, e.g., to identify this {{title}} outside of FHIR, where it is not possible to use the logical URI

  Summary = y
  Type = string
  Short Name = Business version of the {{title}}
  Definition = The identifier that is used to identify this version of the {{title}} when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the {{title}} author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence
  Comments = There may be different {{title}} instances that have the same identifier but different versions
  w5 = id.version

  w5 = status

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.experimental
  Card. = 0..1
  Is Modifier = y
  Summary = y
  Type = boolean
  Short Name = For testing purposes, not real usage
  Definition = A boolean value to indicate that this {{title}} is authored for testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to be used for genuine usage.
  Requirements = Enables experimental content to be developed following the same lifecycle that would be used for a production-level {{title}}
  Comments = Allows filtering of {{title}} that are appropriate for use vs. not. This is labeled as \"Is Modifier\" because applications should not use an experimental {{title}} in production.

  Aliases = Revision Date
  Summary = y
  Type = dateTime
  Short Name = Date this was last changed
  Definition = The date  (and optionally time) when the {{title}} was published. The date must change if and when the business version changes and it must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of the {{title}} changes.
  Comments = Note that this is not the same as the resource last-modified-date, since the resource may be a secondary representation of the {{title}}. Additional specific dates may be added as extensions or be found by consulting Provenances associated with past versions of the resource.

  Definition = The name of the individual or organization that published the {{title}}.
  Requirements = Helps establish the \"authority/credibility\" of the {{title}}.  May also allow for contact
  Comments = Usually an organization, but may be an individual. The publisher (or steward) of the {{title}} is the organization or individual primarily responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the {{title}}.

This item SHOULD be populated unless the information is available from context (e.g. the language of the profile is presumed to be the predominant language in the place the profile was created).

 -- Row 15 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.purpose
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = markdown
  Short Name = Why this {{title}} is defined
  Definition = Explains why this {{title}} is needed and why it has been designed as it has.

This may be used to point to source materials or specifications that drove the structure of this {{title}}.
  Object Impl = no-gen-base
