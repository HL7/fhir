<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The PractitionerRole describes the types of services that practitioners provide for an organization at specific location(s).
</p>
<p>
The PractitionerRole resource can be used in multiple contexts including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provider Registries where it indicates what a practitioner can perform for an organization (may indicate multiple healthcareservices, locations, and roles)</li>
  <li>In a Clinical system where it indicates the role, healthcareservice and location details associated with a practitioner that are applicable to the healthcare event (e.g. Observation, Appointment, Condition, CarePlan)</li>
  <li>In a Clinical system as a point of reference rather than an event, such as a patient's preferred general practitioner (at a specific clinic)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The role, specialty, Location telecom and HealthcareService properties can be repeated if required in other instances
of the PractitionerRole. Some systems record a collection of service values for a single location, others record the 
single service and the list of locations it is available. Both are acceptable options for representing this data.<br/>
Where availability, telecom, or other details are not the same across all healthcareservices, or locations 
a separate PractitionerRole instance should be created.
</p>
<p>
Many resource types have a choice of a reference to either a Practitioner resource or a PractitionerRole resource. The latter
provides organizational context for the practitioners participation when it is required, otherwise a direct reference to the
practitioner may be used.<br/>
Many implementations may choose to profile the PractitionerRole to a single location/role/healthcareservice for their specific usage.<br/>
As the property that references a PractitionerRole typically has a specific context, the code on the PractitionerRole having duplicate code values is not a big concern (and is used for discovery where required).<br/>
e.g. These references are all very context specific: Patient.GeneralPractitioner, CarePlan.reported, CarePlan.contributor, Appointment.participant (through the participant.role), Immunization.informationSource, Immunization.performer (through the performer.function property)
</p>
<p>
For use cases where an organization has activities where a practitioner is not defined/pre-allocated for a specific role 
(e.g. an un-named surgeon at XYZ Hospital), a PractitionerRole resource can be used with an empty Practitioner property, 
and the other relevant role properties populated - i.e. code, organization.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
	Qualifications (from the Practitioner resource) do not imply a Role, but might be considered when an Organization 
  allocates practitioners to roles within their organization, and could provide useful information (such as expiry information)
  which could need to be tracked in some situations to ensure they continue to be eligible for a specific role.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="careteam.html">CareTeam</a> resource is also often used to provide details of a role that a practitioner is
  allocated to perform, but is usually scoped to a much finer granularity of care, and often within the specific context
  of a <a href="patient.html">Patient</a>, or functional role (e.g. Crisis planning team). In contrast the PractitionerRole
  is used in a more general sense to cover all the places that the practitioner is allocated to work (and specific details
  relevant to that role - such as a specific contact number, or electronic services endpoint).
</p>
<p>
When referencing a practitioner from clinical (or other) content where the organization and role are important to the context 
of the reference to the practitioner, then a reference to the PractitionerRole should be used.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
Practitioner performs different roles within the same or even different organizations. Depending on jurisdiction and custom, 
it may be necessary to maintain a specific Practitioner Resource for each such role or have a single Practitioner with multiple roles.
The role can be limited to a specific period, after which authorization for this role ends. Note that the represented organization
need not necessarily be the (direct) employer of a Practitioner.
