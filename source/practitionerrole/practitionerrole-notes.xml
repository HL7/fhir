<ul>
  <li>
  There is no address on the PractitionerRole as the location that is defined here contains the address.<br/>
  This prevents having to duplicate the address values across multiple resources.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a name="mult-locations"></a>
    As briefly noted in the boundaries and relationships section the PractitionerRole resource can be used
    to represent multiple locations in the one resource instance, however this should be done with care.
    When representing multiple locations in an instance, and/or multiple specialties, all details apply
    to all locations. Using that approach you cannot differentiate a different contact number, different
    availabilities, or different services at each location.<br/>
    Hence maintaining these records needs to ensure that when changing a value, such as availability, 
    it applies to all locations. If different values are required for the different locations, then a new 
    instance will need to be created, and then split as appropriate. Existing resources referencing the
    original PractitionerRole instance will need to be updated to refer to the appropriate record.<br/>
    For this reason we expect that it will be common to profile the location element down to a single location,
    simplifying overall usage, and the availabilities are clear that they apply to this location, and any
    referenced healthcare services.
