  Id = 1
  Code = initial-population
  Display = Initial Population
  Definition = The initial population refers to all patients or events to be evaluated by a quality measure involving patients who share a common set of specified characterstics. All patients or events counted (for example, as numerator, as denominator) are drawn from the initial population

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Id = 2
  Code = numerator
  Display = Numerator
  Definition = The upper portion of a fraction used to calculate a rate, proportion, or ratio. Also called the measure focus, it is the target process, condition, event, or outcome. Numerator criteria are the processes or outcomes expected for each patient, or event defined in the denominator. A numerator statement describes the clinical action that satisfies the conditions of the measure

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Id = 3
  Code = numerator-exclusion
  Display = Numerator Exclusion
  Definition = Numerator exclusion criteria define patients or events to be removed from the numerator. Numerator exclusions are used in proportion and ratio measures to help narrow the numerator (for inverted measures)

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Id = 4
  Code = denominator
  Display = Denominator
  Definition = The lower portion of a fraction used to calculate a rate, proportion, or ratio. The denominator can be the same as the initial population, or a subset of the initial population to further constrain the population for the purpose of the measure

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Id = 5
  Code = denominator-exclusion
  Display = Denominator Exclusion
  Definition = Denominator exclusion criteria define patients or events that should be removed from the denominator before determining if numerator criteria are met. Denominator exclusions are used in proportion and ratio measures to help narrow the denominator.

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Id = 6
  Code = denominator-exception
  Display = Denominator Exception
  Definition = Denominator exceptions are conditions that should remove a patient or event from the denominator of a measure only if the numerator criteria are not met.

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Id = 8
  Code = measure-population-exclusion
  Display = Measure Population Exclusion
  Definition = Measure population criteria define the patients or events that should be removed from the measure population before determining the outcome of one or more continuous variables defined for the measure observation.

  Use = in
  Documentation = The measure to evaluate. This parameter is only required when the operation is invoked on the resource type, it is not used when invoking the operation on a Measure instance
  Type = Reference(Measure)
  Title = Measure
  Min = 0
  Max = 1

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Name = evaluate-measure.reportType
  Use = in
  Documentation = The type of measure report, patient, patient-list, or population. If not specified, a default value of patient will be used if the patient parameter is supplied, otherwise, population will be used
  Type = code
  Title = Report type
  Min = 0
  Max = 1

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Name = evaluate-measure.patient
  Use = in
  Documentation = Patient to evaluate against. If not specified, the measure will be evaluated for all patients that meet the requirements of the measure. If specified, only the referenced patient will be evaluated
  Type = Reference(Patient)
  Title = Patient
  Min = 0
  Max = 1

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Name = evaluate-measure.practitioner
  Use = in
  Documentation = Practitioner to evaluate. If specified, the measure will be evaluated only for patients whose primary practitioner is the identified practitioner
  Type = Reference(Practitioner)
  Title = Practitioner
  Min = 0
  Max = 1

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Name = evaluate-measure.lastReceivedOn
  Use = in
  Documentation = The date the results of this measure were last received. This parameter is only valid for patient-level reports and is used to indicate when the last time a result for this patient was received. This information can be used to limit the set of resources returned for a patient-level report
  Type = dateTime
  Title = Last Received On
  Min = 0
  Max = 1

 -- Row 9 -----------------------------------
  Name = evaluate-measure.return
  Use = out
  Documentation = The results of the measure calculation. See the MeasureReport resource for a complete description of the output of this operation
  Type = MeasureReport
  Title = Return
  Min = 1
  Max = 1

 -- Row 10 -----------------------------------
  Name = data-requirements
  Use = Instance
  Documentation = The data-requirements operation aggregates and returns the parameters and data requirements for the measure and all its dependencies as a single module definition
  Type = operation
  Example.Request = $data-requirements-request.txt
  Example.Response = $data-requirements-response.txt
  Title = Data Requirements
  Footer = The effect of invoking this operation is to determine the aggregate set of data requirements and dependencies for the measure. The result is a Library resource with a type of module-definition that contains all the parameter definitions and data requirements of the libraries referenced by the measures. Implementations SHOULD aggregate data requirements intelligently (i.e. by collapsing overlapping data requirements)

 -- Row 11 -----------------------------------
  Name = data-requirements.periodStart
  Use = in
  Documentation = The start of the measurement period. In keeping with the semantics of the date parameter used in the FHIR search operation, the period will start at the beginning of the period implied by the supplied timestamp. E.g. a value of 2014 would set the period start to be 2014-01-01T00:00:00 inclusive
  Type = date
  Title = Period Start
  Min = 1
  Max = 1

 -- Row 12 -----------------------------------
  Name = data-requirements.periodEnd
  Use = in
  Documentation = The end of the measurement period. The period will end at the end of the period implied by the supplied timestamp. E.g. a value of 2014 would set the period end to be 2014-12-31T23:59:59 inclusive
  Type = date
  Title = Period End
  Min = 1
  Max = 1

 -- Row 13 -----------------------------------
  Name = data-requirements.return
  Use = out
  Documentation = The result of the requirements gathering is a module-definition Library that describes the aggregate parameters, data requirements, and dependencies of the measure
  Type = Library
  Title = Return
  Min = 1
  Max = 1
