<h2>Differences from DSTU Release 2</h2>

<p>
This is an automatically generated list of all the structural differences between
FHIR DSTU2 and this version. The following possible changes are checked when 
preparing this list (and others throughout the specification):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Addition or deletion of elements, or name change to elements</li>
  <li>Changes to minimum and maximum cardinality</li>
  <li>Changes to allowed types</li>
  <li>Changes to bindings for Extensible/Required bindings, and changes to codes if it's a required binding on a code element</li>
  <li>Changes to the is-modifier status of an element</li>
  <li>Changes to the default value for an element</li>
</ul>
<p>
This analysis only considers changes to data types and resources. Comparison of extensions, profiles and value sets will be 
added in a future version.
