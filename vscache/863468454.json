An addendum signature can either be a signature type or a signature sub-type (see 8.1). Any document with an addendum signature shall have a companion document that is the original document with its original, unaltered content, and original signatures. The original document shall be referenced via an attribute in the new document, which contains, for example, the digest of the old document.

An administrative (error/edit) signature must include an addendum to the document and therefore shall have an addendum signature sub-type (see 8.1). This signature is reserved for the highest health information system administrative classification, since it is a statement that the entire document is invalidated by the error and that the document should no longer be used for patient care, although for legal reasons the document must remain part of the permanent patient record.</td></tr></table></div>"},"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/valueset-oid","valueUri":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.2.99"}],"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/contract-signer-type","version":"1.3.0","name":"Signature Type Codes","status":"draft","experimental":true,"publisher":"ASTM","contact":[{"telecom":[{"system":"other","value":"http://www.astm.org/"}]}],"date":"2016-01-29T08:33:13+11:00","description":"The Digital Signature Purposes, an indication of the reason an entity signs a document.
