Any profession or business, including healthcare, is primarily constituted of intentional and occasionally non-intentional actions, performed and recorded by responsible actors. An Act-instance is a record of such an action.<br/>\r\n\n                        Acts connect to Entities in their Roles through Participations and connect to other Acts through ActRelationships. Participations are the authors, performers and other responsible parties as well as subjects and beneficiaries (which includes tools and material used in the performance of the act, which are also subjects). The moodCode distinguishes between Acts that are meant as factual records, vs. records of intended or ordered services, and the other modalities in which act can appear.<br/>\r\n\n                        One of the Participations that all acts have (at least implicitly) is a primary author, who is responsible of the Act and who &quot;owns&quot; the act. Responsibility for the act means responsibility for what is being stated in the Act and as what it is stated. Ownership of the act is assumed in the sense of who may operationally modify the same act. Ownership and responsibility of the Act is not the same as ownership or responsibility of what the Act-object refers to in the real world. The same real world activity can be described by two people, each being the author of their Act, describing the same real world activity. Yet one can be a witness while the other can be a principal performer. The performer has responsibilities for the physical actions; the witness only has responsibility for making a true statement to the best of his or her ability. The two Act-instances may even disagree, but because each is properly attributed to its author, such disagreements can exist side by side and left to arbitration by a recipient of these Act-instances.<br/>\r\n\n                        In this sense, an Act-instance represents a &quot;statement&quot; according to Rector and Nowlan (1991) [Foundations for an electronic medical record. Methods Inf Med. 30.]  Rector and Nowlan have emphasized the importance of understanding the medical record not as a collection of facts, but &quot;a faithful record of what clinicians have heard, seen, thought, and done.&quot; Rector and Nowlan go on saying that &quot;the other requirements for a medical record, e.g., that it be attributable and permanent, follow naturally from this view.&quot; Indeed the Act class is this attributable statement, and the rules of updating acts (discussed in the state-transition model, see Act.statusCode) versus generating new Act-instances are designed according to this principle of permanent attributable statements.<br/>\r\n\n                        Rector and Nolan focus on the electronic medical record as a collection of statements, while attributed statements, these are still mostly factual statements. However, the Act class goes beyond this limitation to attributed factual statements, representing what is known as &quot;speech-acts&quot; in linguistics and philosophy.  The notion of speech-act includes that there is pragmatic meaning in language utterances, aside from just factual statements; and that these utterances interact with the real world to change the state of affairs, even directly cause physical activities to happen. For example, an order is a speech act that (provided it is issued adequately) will cause the ordered action to be physically performed. The speech act theory has culminated in the seminal work by Austin (1962) [How to do things with words. Oxford University Press].<br/>\r\n\n                        An activity in the real world may progress from defined, through planned and ordered to executed, which is represented as the mood of the Act. Even though one might think of a single activity as progressing from planned to executed, this progression is reflected by multiple Act-instances, each having one and only one mood that will not change along the Act-instance life cycle.  This is because the attribution and content of speech acts along this progression of an activity may be different, and it is often critical that a permanent and faithful record be maintained of this progression. The specification of orders or promises or plans must not be overwritten by the specification of what was actually done, so as to allow comparing actions with their earlier specifications. Act-instances that describe this progression of the same real world activity are linked through the ActRelationships (of the relationship category &quot;sequel&quot;).<br/>\r\n\n                        Act as statements or speech-acts are the only representation of real world facts or processes in the HL7 RIM. The truth about the real world is constructed through a combination (and arbitration) of such attributed statements only, and there is no class in the RIM whose objects represent &quot;objective state of affairs&quot; or &quot;real processes&quot; independent from attributed statements. As such, there is no distinction between an activity and its documentation. Every Act includes both to varying degrees. For example, a factual statement made about recent (but past) activities, authored (and signed) by the performer of such activities, is commonly known as a procedure report or original documentation (e.g., surgical procedure report, clinic note etc.). Conversely, a status update on an activity that is presently in progress, authored by the performer (or a close observer) is considered to capture that activity (and is later superceded by a full procedure report). However, both status update and procedure report are acts of the same kind, only distinguished by mood and state (see statusCode) and completeness of the information.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>2</td><td>  <span style=\"color: grey\"><i>(_ActClassRecordOrganizer)</i></span> <b><i>Abstract</i></b></td><td><a name=\"_ActClassRecordOrganizer\"> </a></td><td>\n                        Used to group a set of acts sharing a common context.

The public health case can include a health-related event concerning a single individual or it may refer to multiple health-related events that are occurrences of the same disease or condition of interest to public health.<br/>\r\n\n                        A public health case definition (Act.moodCode = &quot;definition&quot;) includes the description of the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic indicators associated with a disease or condition of interest to public health. There are case definitions for conditions that are reportable, as well as for those that are not. A public health case definition is a construct used by public health for the purpose of counting cases, and should not be used as clinical indications for treatment. Examples include AIDS, toxic-shock syndrome, and salmonellosis and their associated indicators that are used to define a case.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>3</td><td>    OUTBR<a name=\"OUTBR\"> </a></td><td>outbreak</td><td>\n                        An Outbreak is a concern resulting from a series of public health cases.<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           UsageNotes: The date on which an outbreak starts is the earliest date of onset among the cases assigned to the outbreak and its ending date is the last date of onset among the cases assigned to the outbreak.

Often an institution has a number of different consent forms for various purposes, including reminding the physician about the topics to mention. Such forms also include patient education material. In electronic medical record communication, consents thus are information-generating acts on their own and need to be managed similar to medical activities. Thus, Consent is modeled as a special class of Act.<br/>\r\n\n                        The &quot;signatures&quot; to the consent document are represented electronically through Participation instances to the consent object. Typically an informed consent has Participation.typeCode of &quot;performer&quot;, the healthcare provider informing the patient, and &quot;consenter&quot;, the patient or legal guardian. Some consent may associate a witness or a notary public (e.g., living wills, advanced directives). In consents where a healthcare provider is not required (e.g. living will), the performer may be the patient himself or a notary public.<br/>\r\n\n                        Some consent has a minimum required delay between the consent and the service, so as to allow the patient to rethink his decisions.

His GP does not realize that the patient has, 20 years previously (while at college) had severe alcohol addiction problems, and now, although this is completely under control, his liver has suffered significantly, leaving him more sensitive to hepatic toxicity from paracetamol use.  Later that year, the patient returns with a noticeable level of jaundice.  Paracetamol is immediately withdrawn and alternative solutions for the knee pain are sought.  The jaundice gradually subsides with conservative management, but referral to the gastroenterologist is required for advice and monitoring. <br/>\r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    There is a substance administration with an associated exposure.

The GP can find nothing particularly amiss, and presumes it is post operative surgical pain that will resolve.  The patient returns a fortnight later, when the GP prescribes further analgesia, but does decide to request an outpatient surgical follow-up appointment.  At this post-surgical outpatient review, the registrar decides to order an ultrasound, which, when performed three weeks later, shows a small faint inexplicable mass.  A laparoscopy is then performed, as a day case procedure, and a piece of a surgical swab is removed from the patient's abdominal cavity.

The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The code attribute of Observation and the value attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           Discussion:\n                        <br/>\r\n\n                        Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a  variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.<br/>\r\n\n                        As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects. <br/>\r\n\n                        The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.<br/>\r\n\n                        An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.<br/>\r\n\n                        Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC. <br/>\r\n\n                        Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation. <br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           Examples:\n                        <br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              Recording the results of a Family History Assessment<br/>\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Laboratory test and associated result<br/>\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Physical exam test and associated result<br/>\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Device temperature<br/>\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Soil lead level<br/>\r\n\n                           \n                        \n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>3</td><td>    <span style=\"color: grey\"><i>(_ActClassROI)</i></span> <b><i>Abstract</i></b></td><td><a name=\"_ActClassROI\"> </a></td><td>\n                        Regions of Interest (ROI) within a subject Act.

The relationship between a ROI and its referenced Act is specified through an ActRelationship of type subject (SUBJ), which must always be present. Each of the boundary criteria observations is connected with the ROI using ActRelationships of type &quot;has component&quot; (COMP). In each boundary criterion, the Act.code names the dimension and the Observation.value specifies the range of values inside the region. Typically the bounded dimension is continuous, and so the Observation.value will be an interval (IVL) data type. The Observation.value need not be specified if the respective dimension is only named but not constrained. For example, an ROI for the QT interval of a certain beat in ECG Lead II would contain 2 boundary criteria, one naming the interval in time (constrained), and the other naming the interval in ECG Lead II (only named, but not constrained).<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>4</td><td>      ROIOVL<a name=\"ROIOVL\"> </a></td><td>overlay ROI</td><td>\n                        A Region of Interest (ROI) specified for an image using an overlay shape.

The public health case can include a health-related event concerning a single individual or it may refer to multiple health-related events that are occurrences of the same disease or condition of interest to public health. An outbreak involving multiple individuals may be considered as a type of public health case. A public health case definition (Act.moodCode = &quot;definition&quot;) includes the description of the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic indicators associated with a disease or condition of interest to public health. There are case definitions for conditions that are reportable, as well as for those that are not. There are also case definitions for outbreaks. A public health case definition is a construct used by public health for the purpose of counting cases, and should not be used as clinical indications for treatment.
