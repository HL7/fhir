Two parameters a and b  are available to adjust the curve.  The mean m and variance s2 relate as follows: m = a/ (a + b) and s2 = ab/((a + b)2 (a + b + 1)).<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>E<a name=\"E\"> </a></td><td>exponential</td><td>\n                        Used for data that describes extinction.

The F-distribution has two parameters n1 and n2, which are the numbers of degrees of freedom of the numerator and denominator variable respectively. The relationship to mean m  and variance s2 are: m = n2 / (n2 - 2) and s2 = (2 n2 (n2 + n1 - 2)) / (n1 (n2 - 2)2 (n2 - 4)).<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>G<a name=\"G\"> </a></td><td>(gamma)</td><td>\n                        The gamma-distribution used for data that is skewed and bounded to the right, i.e. where the maximum of the distribution curve is located near the origin.  The g-distribution has a two parameters a and b.

The log-normal distribution can be specified with the properties mean m and standard deviation s.  Note however that mean m and standard deviation s are the parameters of the raw value distribution, not the transformed parameters of the lognormal distribution that are conventionally referred to by the same letters.  Those log-normal parameters mlog and slog relate to the mean m and standard deviation s of the data value through slog2 = log (s2/m2 + 1) and mlog = log m - slog2/2.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>N<a name=\"N\"> </a></td><td>normal (Gaussian)</td><td>\n                        This is the well-known bell-shaped normal distribution.  Because of the central limit theorem, the normal distribution is the distribution of choice for an unbounded random variable that is an outcome of a combination of many stochastic processes.  Even for values bounded on a single side (i.e. greater than 0) the normal distribution may be accurate enough if the mean is &quot;far away&quot; from the bound of the scale measured in terms of standard deviations.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>T<a name=\"T\"> </a></td><td>T</td><td>\n                        Used to describe the quotient of a normal random variable and the square root of a c2 random variable.  The t-distribution has one parameter n, the number of degrees of freedom.

The width of this interval is 2s sqrt(3).  Thus, the uniform distribution assigns the probability densities f(x) = sqrt(2 s sqrt(3))  to values m - s sqrt(3) &gt;= x &lt;= m + s sqrt(3) and f(x) = 0 otherwise.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>X2<a name=\"X2\"> </a></td><td>chi square</td><td>\n                        Used to describe the sum of squares of random variables which occurs when a variance is estimated (rather than presumed) from the sample.  The only parameter of the c2-distribution is n, so called the number of degrees of freedom (which is the number of independent parts in the sum).  The c2-distribution is a special type of g-distribution with parameter a = n /2 and b  = 2.  Hence, m = n and s2 = 2 n.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>"},"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v3-ProbabilityDistributionType","identifier":[{"system":"urn:ietf:rfc:3986","value":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.10747"}],"version":"2016-11-11","name":"v3 Code System ProbabilityDistributionType","status":"active","experimental":false,"date":"2016-11-11","publisher":"HL7, Inc","contact":[{"telecom":[{"system":"url","value":"http://hl7.org"}]}],"description":"**** MISSING DEFINITIONS ****","immutable":true,"compose":{"include":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ProbabilityDistributionType"}]},"expansion":{"identifier":"urn:uuid:8468b981-5cea-437c-96e8-943b27238be3","timestamp":"2017-03-09T21:42:41+11:00","total":9,"parameter":[{"name":"version","valueUri":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ProbabilityDistributionType|2016-11-11"}],"contains":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ProbabilityDistributionType","code":"B","display":"beta"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ProbabilityDistributionType","code":"E","display":"exponential"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ProbabilityDistributionType","code":"F","display":"F"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ProbabilityDistributionType","code":"G","display":"(gamma)"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ProbabilityDistributionType","code":"LN","display":"log-normal"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ProbabilityDistributionType","code":"N","display":"normal (Gaussian)"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ProbabilityDistributionType","code":"T","display":"T"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ProbabilityDistributionType","code":"U","display":"uniform"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ProbabilityDistributionType","code":"X2","display":"chi square"}]}}
