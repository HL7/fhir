It is acknowledged that many clinicians may not be in a position to distinguish the mechanism of a particular reaction. Often the term ""allergy"" is used rather generically and may overlap with the use of ""intolerance"" - in practice the boundaries between these two concepts may not be well-defined or understood. This data element is included nevertheless, because many legacy systems have captured this attribute. Immunologic testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis of the reaction and the causative substance, but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for sensitivity to a particular substance.

Additional details can be specified in the text.  When a substance or product code is specified for the 'code' element, the ""default"" semantic context is that this is a positive statement of an allergy or intolerance (depending on the value of the 'type' element, if present) condition to the specified substance/product.  In the corresponding SNOMED CT allergy model, the specified substance/product is the target (destination) of the ""Causative agent"" relationship.  The 'substanceExposureRisk' extension is available as a structured and more flexible alternative to the 'code' element for making positive or negative allergy or intolerance statements.  This extension provides the capability to make ""no known allergy"" (or ""no risk of adverse reaction"") statements regarding any coded substance/product (including cases when a pre-coordinated ""no allergy to x"" concept for that substance/product does not exist).
