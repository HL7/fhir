  <h3>FHIR Record Lifecycle Events Implementation Guide</h3>
  <p>
    This implementation guide describes the expected capabilities for an Electronic Health Record System (EHR-S) that intends to adhere to the ISO/HL7 10781 Electronic 
    Health Record System Functional Model Release 2 which covers the logging of record lifecycle events. This implementation guide consists of three parts:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <a href="ehrsrle-provenance.html">Profile</a> on the <a href="../provenance.html">Provenance</a> resource describing the
      information that should be retained for events involving the creation or updating of electronic health records</li>
    <li>A <a href="ehrsrle-auditevent.html">Profile</a> on the <a href="../auditevent.html">AuditEvent</a> resource describing the
      information that should be retained for events involving the access or any other manipulation of electronic health records</li>
    <li>A <a href="conformance-ehrs-rle.html">Conformance Statement</a> which describes the operations an EHR system claiming conformance
      to this implementation guide must support.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For the purposes of this implementation guide, "must support" means that the system must be capable of capturing and recording those data elements which are so-marked.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      This Implementation Guide offers a methodology to support trusted electronic health record (EHR) management using HL7 Fast Health Interoperable Resources (FHIR). 
      This approach is based on the Record Infrastructure Section of ISO/HL7 10781 Electronic Health Record System Functional Model (EHR-S FM) Release 2 and ISO DTS 21089 
      Trusted End-to-End Information Flows. (This IG is also intended to be applicable to upcoming ISO/HL7 16527 Personal Health Record System Functional Model (PHR-S FM) 
      Release 2, which will incorporate the Record Infrastructure Section.)

    <h3>Actions and Record Entries</h3>
    <p>
      From EHR-S FM, Record Infrastructure, Section RI.1, Record Lifecycle and Lifespan:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:13.5pt;">
      "Actions are taken to support patient health. Actions are taken in provision of healthcare to individuals. Actions are taken as the result of rules-based EHR 
      System algorithms. Actors (i.e., patients, providers, users, systems) take Actions. (Actions broadly encompass tasks, acts, procedures or services performed or 
      provided.)
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:13.5pt;">
      "The EHR System captures Actions taken and creates corresponding Record Entries. Record Entries provide persistent evidence of Action occurrence, context, 
      disposition, facts, findings and observations. From the point of Record Entry origination to the end of its lifespan, the EHR System manages each Entry consistent 
      with and according to scope of practice, organizational policy, and jurisdictional law. In support of individual health and in provision of healthcare to 
      individuals, Actors perform Actions and Actions have corresponding Entries in the EHR Record, (i.e., Action instances are documented by Record Entry instances). 
      Record Entries may be captured during the course of the Action or sometime thereafter. The Actor (author/source) of the Record Entry may be the same as an 
      Actor performing the Action or not...
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:13.5pt;">
      "Actions have associated metadata (e.g., who, what, when, where, why, how, under what conditions, in what context). The corresponding Record Entry captures this 
      metadata along with other Action and Record Entry related information.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:13.5pt;">
      "Each Record Entry also includes its own provenance metadata such as who (authoring Actor) and when (documented). Record Entries may be encapsulated to bind 
      Actor (individual, organization, and/or system) signatures to data and metadata content and data/time of occurrence. Actions and related Record Entries capture 
      a chronology of patient health and healthcare and also a chronology of operations and services provided in/by a healthcare enterprise. Record Entries reflect 
      changes in health information from the time it was created, to the time it was amended, sent, received, etc. In this manner, each Record Entry serves as 
      persistent evidence of an Action taken, enabling providers to maintain comprehensive information that may be needed for legal, [clinical,] business, and 
      disclosure purposes. To satisfy these purposes, Record Entries must also be retained and persisted without alteration. Record Entries have both a lifecycle 
      and a lifespan. Lifecycle Events include originate, retain, amend, verify, attest, access/view, de-identify, transmit/receive, and more. Lifecycle Events occur 
      at various points in a Record Entry lifespan, always starting with a point of origination and retention (i.e., when the Entry is first created and stored).
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:13.5pt;">
      "A Record Entry may have a pre and post Event state if content is modified. In this case, the original Record Entry is preserved (with signature binding) and a new 
      Entry is created (with new signature binding). A Record Entry contains data and metadata, in multiple formats, following various conventions and standards. Included 
      data may be tagged, and/or delimited, structured (concise, encoded, computable), or unstructured (free form, non-computable). Data may be encoded as text, 
      document, images, audio, waveforms, in ASCII, binary or other encoding."
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:13.5pt;">
      EHR, PHR and other Systems, designed to follow ISO/HL7 10781 and ISO 21089 record management methodology and incorporate FHIR resources natively, will create 
      Record Entries with one or more FHIR resource instances. These FHIR resources will be bound to an
       <a href="../auditevent.html" shape="rect">AuditEvent</a>resource instance and, in the case where content is new or updated, a 
       <a href="../provenance.html" shape="rect">Provenance</a>resource instance in the Record Entry.
     </p>

    <h3>Record Lifecycle Events (RLEs)</h3>
    <p>
      As described above, Record Entries have a lifespan and may have lifecycle events (RLEs) occurring during that lifespan. Following is the current list of RLEs:

    <h3>CRUDE Events</h3>
    <p>
      CRUDE = Create, Read, Update, Delete, Execute. Record Lifecycle Events (RLEs) are specializations of basic CRUDE events for purposes of health data/record 
      management end-to-end. End-to-end means: 1) for the duration of data/record lifespan within the source EHR, PHR or other system, and 2) following the path of 
      data/record exchange system by system downstream to the ultimate point of access/use.
    </p>
    <p>
      FHIR resources – when captured natively in the source EHR, PHR or other system Record Entries – include resources resulting from the Action taken (e.g., 
      register patient, order medication, take progress note). Plus, all RLEs depend on the AuditEvent resource to capture basic metadata. Plus, all RLEs which 
      <b>C</b>reate or <b>U</b>pdate resource content depend on the Provenance resource to capture content-related metadata. The following table shows how RLEs 
      relate to CRUDE events. Some RLEs create separate new artifacts as shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="color:blue">RLEs in blue</span> are included in FHIR Connectathon Tracks and are currently limited to basic <b>C</b>, <b>R</b>, and <b>U</b> events.
