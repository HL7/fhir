Structured Data Capture Implementation Guide

This is a [FHIR](http://hl7.org/fhir) implementation guide focused on using the Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse resources to allow creation, automated population and subsequent submission of forms.  It was initially created under the sponsorship of the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Healthcare (ONC).
