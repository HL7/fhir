This role is responsible for retrieving pre-defined forms, requesting pre-population of forms and/or auto-populating forms, guiding the user through verifying populated data and submitting completed or partially-completed forms.</p>\n      <p>Note that Form Fillers may also take on the role of <a href=\"sdc-form-archiver.html\">Form Archiver</a> if they have a requirement to retain the completed version of a form (and potentially the source data that was used to complete it).</p>\n      <h2>General</h2>\n      <table>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr>\n            <th>FHIR Version:</th>\n            <td>$ver$</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <th>Supported formats:</th>\n            <td>xml, json</td>\n          </tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n      <h2>REST  behavior</h2>\n      <p>The <a href=\"{{site.data.fhir.path}}questionnaire.html\">Questionnaire</a>, <a href=\"{{site.data.fhir.path}}valueset.html\">ValueSet</a> and <a href=\"{{site.data.fhir.path}}codesystem.html\">CodeSystem</a> resources are retrieved to allow the system to guide the user through the entry process.  The <a href=\"{{site.data.fhir.path}}binary.html\">Binary</a> and <a href=\"{{site.data.fhir.path}}documentreference.html\">DocumentReference</a> resources allow the system to find existing clinical documents that can be within the pre-population process.
